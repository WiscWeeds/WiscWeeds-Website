With another growing season coming to an end, the planning for next year’s weed management decisions should have already begun. Fortunately for Wisconsin producers two new tank-mix herbicides have been recently registered for use in Wisconsin corn production. It is important to note that these herbicides do not contain novel sites of action nor active ingredients. These products consist of new tank-mixes of active ingredients that are already commercially available in other herbicides. Remember that the use of herbicides with multiple effective sites of action is one of the recommended foundational strategies of an effective integrated weed management program that minimizes the risk of the development of herbicide-resistant weeds. Let’s dive into the details of these new products. 

**Valent USA** has released **Maverick<sup>TM</sup>** for control of annual grass and broadleaf weeds in field corn, seed corn, silage corn, and yellow popcorn. Maverick TM consists of clopyralid (group 4), pyroxasulfone (group 15) and mesotrione (group 27).

**Corteva Agriscience** has released **Resicore® XL** for control of annual grasses and broadleaf weeds in field corn, field seed corn, field silage corn, and yellow popcorn.

Resicore® XL has an extended application window (up to 24” corn) compared to Resicore® (up to 11” corn).
