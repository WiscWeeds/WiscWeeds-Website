Earlier this year we received a few complaints regarding lack of performance of **dicamba** (XtendiMax, Engenia, Status), **2,4-D** (Enlist One) and/or **glufosinate** (Liberty) on POST control of waterhemp in corn and soybean fields in Wisconsin.

We invite Wisconsin farmers and agronomists to collect waterhemp seeds this fall from their row crop production fields where one of these three herbicides failed to provide effective POST control and submit them to UW-Madison for herbicide resistance screenings.

There is no cost associated to the herbicide resistance screening. The only cost will be your time to collect the seed samples and mail them to: **Rodrigo Werle, 1575 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706.** We intend to screen all waterhemp samples in the greenhouse for resistance to 2,4-D, dicamba and glufosinate.

Please download the [**SEED COLLECTION FORM**] (/img/2018 waterhemp seed collection/2021 WiscWeeds Waterhemp Seed Project.pdf) (PDF file) for information on how to collect the waterhemp seeds for the project. Please fill out the information necessary for each waterhemp sample collected [**ONLINE (Qualtrics Survey)**](https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3wQ6hrFrjfR0FrU). 

submit the form with the seed sample. Samples will only be included in the herbicide resistance screening if the information requested herein is provided by the farmer/agronomist.    

For questions, please contact Rodrigo Werle via e-mail: **rwerle@wisc.edu**.  

We thank the **Wisconsin Soybean Marketing Board** and the **Take Action Program** for supporting this project and also those submitting the waterhemp seed samples.
