A group of farmers from southern Wisconsin recently asked whether they could visit our cover crop research plots at Arlington Agricultural Research Station; our answer was: *"absolutely; and why not partner up with other UW Extension colleagues and also invite our clientele from other parts of the state?!"*

**Event Description:** Join us on *July 01 from 1:00PM-3:30PM at Arlington Agricultural Research Station* to visit our conventional and organic cover crop research plots, check equipment and exchange knowledge with University Specialists and fellow farmers adopting cover crops in their crop production systems.
