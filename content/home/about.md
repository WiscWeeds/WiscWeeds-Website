[**Rodrigo Werle**] (https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/) is an Assistant Professor and Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist in the Agronomy Department at UW-Madison. His research and extension program [(**WiscWeeds**)] (https://twitter.com/WiscWeeds) focuses on agroecologically-based approaches to address sustainable weed management in **corn, soybeans and small grains** in Wisconsin and beyond. The program also focuses on weed management strategies that can help address herbicide resistance, protect water quality, enhance agroecosystems services and increase food security. 

Rodrigo was born in a small farming community of Dutch immigrants in the state of São Paulo, in southeastern Brazil. His early passion for Agriculture led him to study Agronomy in Brazil and Weed Science at Nebraska, which then brought him and his family to beautiful Wisconsin in 2018.
