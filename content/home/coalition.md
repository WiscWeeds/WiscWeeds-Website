Given the widespread occurrence of herbicide-resistant weeds across Wisconsin Cropping Systems, the shortage of novel herbicide sites of action, and the socioeconomic and environmental challenges herbicide-resistant weeds bring to farming operations and communities, it’s time for our industry to come together and work towards a similar goal: to promote and hopefully achieve effective and sustainable weed control in crop production systems.    

The objective of the WiscWeeds Research Coalition is to bring together Researchers, Educators, Policy Makers, Industry, Consultants, Service Providers, and Growers to work towards preventing the spread, reducing the selection for, and to increase the adoption of integrated management strategies to combat herbicide-resistant weed species. Through the WiscWeeds Research Coalition we expect to develop a strong relationship amongst key stakeholders allowing for effective exchange of materials, practical knowledge and research-based recommendations.
