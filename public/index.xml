      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The adoption of cover crops in corn-soybean production systems can help growers improve cropping system resiliency to extreme weather events, improve soil conservation and health, and slow the evolution of weed herbicide resistance. To get the most out of cover crops prior to corn and soybean establishment, growers should have a sound termination plan in mind to maximize cover crop benefits and successful establishment of the following cash crop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2020 cc termination/CoverCrop Picture.png&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;small&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cover-crop-termination-with-herbicides&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cover Crop Termination with Herbicides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;herbicide-selection&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herbicide Selection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover crop species, weeds present under cover crop residue, and following cash crop should all be considered when selecting the proper herbicide to terminate a cover crop. This will ensure the cover crop does not later become a weed problem, all weeds present are terminated, and the cash crop isn’t negatively impacted by the cover crop and/or herbicide program of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research conducted in Wisconsin indicates that glyphosate is an effective herbicide for termination of annual grass cover crops, including cereal rye and wheat. A 2019 study comparing termination of a winter wheat cover crop found glyphosate (Roundup) to be more effective than glufosinate (Liberty) (Dewerff et al., 2020; Figure 1). See also: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipcm.wisc.edu/download/pubsPM/AnnualRye_WinterRye_Glyphosate.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Termination of Cereal Rye and Annual Ryegrass Using Glyphosate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2020 cc termination/WI_TermHerbFigure.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;small&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Influence of application method and carrier volume on the termination of winter wheat cover crop using glufosinate (32 fl oz Liberty/acre + 1.5 lbs AMS/acre) and glyphosate (22 fl oz Roundup PowerMAX/acre + 1.5 lbs AMS/acre) sprayed at the day of soybean planting (June 05, 2019). Red bars indicate herbicide application using backpack sprayer, gray bars indicate application using a planter-mounted sprayer. Data collected 21 days after treatment. Experiment conducted at Arlington Agricultural Research Station, WI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For termination of broadleaf cover crops there are differences regarding most effective herbicide(s) depending upon cover crop species. For information on effective chemical termination of broadleaf cover crops see: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipm.missouri.edu/IPCM/2020/3/coverCropTermination-KB/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;University of Missouri Final Results from a Multi-state Study on Cover Crop Termination with Herbicides&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipcm.wisc.edu/download/pubsPM/CoverCropTerminationOptions.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;UW NPM Cover Crop Termination&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-considerations-for-herbicide-selection&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other considerations for herbicide selection:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If glyphosate is used for cover crop termination, it should be sprayed when day temperatures are above 55° F and night temperatures are above 40° F. To further improve effective cereal rye control, glyphosate should be applied before the boot stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If glyphosate-resistant weeds are present in your cover crop at termination (e.g., marestail, giant ragweed) adding herbicides such as 2,4-D and/or saflufenacil (e.g., Sharpen) to a glyphosate tank-mix can assist in improving control. This has also been shown to aid in termination of broadleaf cover crops (check product labels for planting restrictions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If using contact herbicides such as paraquat (e.g., Gramoxone) and glufosinate (e.g., Liberty, Cheetah, Scout, etc.), practices that improve spray coverage will improve efficacy (e.g., medium spray droplet size and higher application carrier volumes [≥20 GPA]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applicators and handlers of paraquat (e.g., Gramoxone) are now required by the U.S. EPA to complete training every 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;termination-timing&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination Timing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits associated with using cover crops are correlated to the amount of biomass produced. Allowing cover crops to accumulate as much biomass as possible prior to termination will increase extent and longevity of benefits received, including reduced soil erosion and weed control. Ideally a grower would want to terminate their cover crops at a time when they can obtain the maximum amount of biomass without reducing resources for their cash crop (i.e., water, nutrients, sunlight). In general, the later a cover crop is terminated, the longer cover crop biomass will persist on the soil surface, suppressing weeds and protecting the soil surface (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Effect of termination timing with glyphosate (22 fl oz Roundup PowerMAX/acre + 1.5 lb AMS/acre) on cereal rye cover crop biomass in corn and soybean. Cover Crop terminated approximately two weeks prior to crop planting (Early, May 7), during crop planting (Plant, May 23), and two weeks after crop planting (Late, June 6). Images display remaining cover crop residue at Lancaster Agricultural Research Station, WI on June 18, 2019. Images by K. Grint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential causes of cash crop yield reduction from cover crops include early season nitrogen tie-up limitations in corn, water stress during drought situations when cover crops can reduce available soil water for an early growing crop, competition for light, and/or poorly adjusted and maintained planting equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wet springs, such as in 2019, can make timely termination of cover crops difficult. A study conducted by the Wisconsin Cropping Systems Weed Science program (part of Kolby Grint&amp;rsquo;s MS graduate research) in 2019 at Arlington and Lancaster Agricultural Research Stations, Wisconsin found that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In soybean, termination of a cereal rye cover crop 2 weeks after planting had no impact on yield compared to tillage, no-till, and earlier terminations of a cereal rye cover crop (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In corn, yield was consistently reduced when cereal rye was terminated after planting (Figure 4). It is suspected early season available nitrogen was a limiting factor for corn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2020 cc termination/WISoybeanYield.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;small&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

These findings indicate that soybean is less likely to experience a yield reduction from cover crop termination after planting compared to corn when adequate soil moisture is available (which was the case at all these research sites in 2019).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2020 cc termination/BeanTeam_YieldFigure.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;small&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 5. Soybean yield for no cover crop (NC), termination prior to crop planting (T1), termination at crop planting (T2), and termination approximately 1 week after crop planting (T3).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UW-Madison researchers and many others across the Midwest typically recommend terminating cover crops before crop planting when possible (see: &lt;a href=&#34;http://coolbean.info/library/documents/CPN-4002.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cover Crops Do’s and Don’t’s&lt;/a&gt;). Delaying the termination and planting of fields with cover crops until non-cover cropped fields have been planted can be one way to maximize cover crop biomass accumulation, while minimizing potential for cash crop yield reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-considerations-for-timing-of-cover-crop-termination&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other considerations for timing of cover crop termination:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the forecasted weather conditions? Consider the following question: Is there time to delay termination a my cover crop while still allowing timely establishment of a cash crop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When using herbicides for cover crop termination, efficacy can be reduced after cover crops reach reproductive stages. Termination prior to reproductive stages is recommended for best chemical control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Producers are encouraged to visit with their insurance provider when deciding the time for cover crop termination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If cover crops will be harvested for forage, herbicides should be sprayed after biomass harvest and removal from the field to control the re-growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;considerations-for-herbicides-following-cover-crop-termination&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considerations for Herbicides following Cover Crop Termination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pre-emergence-herbicide-application&#34;&gt;PRE-emergence Herbicide Application&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A grower may decide to spray their PRE-emergence herbicides before, during or after cover crop termination; see &lt;a href=&#34;https://crops.extension.iastate.edu/cropnews/2020/02/managing-residual-herbicides-cover-crops&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Iowa State University Managing Residual Herbicides with Cover Crops&lt;/a&gt;. Cover crop residue can alter the fate of PRE-emergence herbicides. When an abundance of cover crop biomass is present at application there is potential for spray interception and subsequent reduced soil concentration of PRE-emergence herbicides. This is most prevalent when precipitation doesn’t occur soon after herbicide application. Residual herbicide incapable of reaching the soil will not have the desired impact on controlling germinating weed species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If concerned about a PRE-emergence herbicide being ineffective when high amounts of cover crop residue are present, growers may consider including soil residual herbicides with a POST-emergence application (after some of the cover crop residue has decomposed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;post-emergence-herbicide-application&#34;&gt;POST-emergence Herbicide Application&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cover crops alone will likely not provide season-long weed control. POST-emergence herbicides are necessary to maintain control of in-season weeds. As always, scouting is very important for determining when to make a POST-emergence herbicide application. Cover crops typically aren’t as effective for suppression of large seeded weed species (e.g., velvetleaf, giant ragweed).
Including a residual herbicide with POST-emergence  applications can provide extended in season weed control. This can be especially effective when a PRE herbicide wasn’t used or when cover crop residue quickly degrades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If planning to plant cover crops again in the fall, herbicides with soil residual activity should be carefully selected so they don’t negatively impact establishment of the cover crop species intended to use. For additional information on herbicide rotational restrictions for cover crops see: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipcm.wisc.edu/download/pubsPM/2019_RotationalRestrictions_final.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;UW NPM Herbicide Rotational Restrictions for Cover and Forage Cropping Systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;roller-crimper&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roller-Crimper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timing is the most important factor for termination of a cover crop when using a roller-crimper. For grass cover crops, termination should occur when flowering has begun (Figure 6). Full anthesis of cereal rye in WI typically occurs around Memorial Day. For legume cover crops, termination should occur when the plants begin producing pods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If roller-crimping occurs too early the cover crop will not be successfully terminated, if done too late there is risk the seed produced by the cover crop will be viable and add to the weed seedbank. Using a roller-crimper creates a dense mat of residue parallel to the soil surface which has been shown to be one of the best ways to suppress weeds with cover crop residue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For additional information on roller-crimpers, watch the video: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipcm.wisc.edu/blog/2015/07/advances-using-the-roller-crimper-for-organic-no-till-in-wisconsin/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Advances Using the Roller-crimper for Organic No-till in Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;nebraska-and-wisconsin-planting-green-cover-crop-survey&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nebraska and Wisconsin Planting Green Cover Crop Survey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nebraska and Wisconsin farmers were surveyed in early 2020 regarding their successes and challenges from planting green. The target audience was those who already adopt cover crops. A quick look at the responses show that more than half (53%) of growers indicated that they used this practice for planting both corn and soybean. Most farmers reported that they observed none or minor impacts of planting “green” on crop emergence, yields, allelopathic reactions, pests (disease, insects, weeds), and/or fertility. Once we summarize all the survey responses we will share more details about what has worked well and what has been challenging for farmers planting green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you planted green in 2019 or previous growing seasons, please take the time to fill out the quick &lt;a href=&#34;https://ssp.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0St2eD2n5KH9jWB&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planting Green into Cover Crops SURVEY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from our colleagues at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Your participation assists our programs by directing our research to best meet the growers we serve. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enlist E3 Soybean System in 2020: What We Think Applicators Should Know</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Information presented herein does not represent an endorsement of Enlist E3 soybean technology nor any seed trait or herbicide product. The purpose of this publication is solely to educate potential applicators and promote effective use of the Enlist E3 soybean technology from Corteva Agriscience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter has come and gone and Spring is officially here. This means that farmers around Wisconsin and across the Midwest are getting prepared to hit the ground running when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we understand that most seed and chemical orders have been placed and the decision on whether or not to adopt the novel soybean herbicide trait technologies (RR2YX, LLGT27, and Enlist E3) has been made. A recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/survey-wisconsin-soybean-herbicide-tolerance-trait-selection-2019-2020/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the UW-Madison Cropping Systems Weed Science Lab provided interesting insight of how Wisconsin farmers intend to adopt these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey results included 58 participants representing approximately 330,000 soybean acres across 46 WI counties. According to participants, 14% of the represented acres in the survey will be planted with Enlist E3 soybeans in 2020 compared to 1% in 2019. Of those acres, 81% and 63% are expected to receive a 2,4-D choline and glufosinate application POST-emergence, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2020 Enlist E3/2020 HT Trait.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Figure&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the anticipated increased adoption of Enlist E3 soybeans and 2,4-D choline POST-emergence (particularly targeting waterhemp control), this is an essential time to review some of the important information regarding 2,4-D choline applications in Enlist E3 soybeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, Enlist One (2,4-D choline) and Enlist Duo (2,4-D choline and glyphosate premix) are the only 2,4-D products labeled for use in Enlist E3 soybeans. Other 2,4-D products are &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; labeled thus should &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; be used in Enlist E3 soybeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;application-window-and-rate-structure&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application Window and Rate Structure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enlist One application rate: 1.5 – 2 pts/acre*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enlist Duo application rate: 3.5 – 4.75 pts/acre*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply Enlist herbicides when weeds are small (&amp;lt; 4 inches)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply Enlist herbicides no later than R2 (full flowering stage) in Enlist E3 soybeans&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two POST-emergence applications maximum within a growing season with a minimum of 12 days between applications (keep in mind that overreliance will lead to additional weed resistance)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Maximum label rates of Enlist herbicides should be used when managing troublesome weeds such as waterhemp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crops not listed as susceptible on the Enlist One and Enlist Duo labels which can be downwind from application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples of compatible crops:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;non-Enlist soybeans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;corn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wheat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alfalfa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sorghum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;peanuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sugarcane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sweet potato&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, with adequate environmental conditions and proper sprayer setup, Enlist One or Enlist Duo can be sprayed when non-Enlist E3 soybeans are downwind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mixing-and-application-considerations&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixing and Application Considerations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 gallons or more per acre of spray volume (15 GPA is recommended)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use high level of gallonage when tank mixing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use plenty of water between additions for induction tanks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tank-mix sequence procedures (begin with half-full tank of water; begin agitation and continue throughout mixing process):

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMS / water conditioning agents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-slurry water-soluble packets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wettable powders / dry flowables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compatibility agents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liquid flowables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capsule suspension (CS) or suspension emulsion (SE)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emulsifiable concentrate (EC)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soluble liquids (SL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enlist Duo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enlist One*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glyphosate products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crop Oil Concentrate (COC), NIS, other adjuvants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top off with water carrier
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;When mixing with Enlist One, do not pour glufosinate products or potassium salt of glyphosate into the tank at the same time as Enlist One. Add products one at a time, allowing enough time for recirculation between additions of each separate product.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;approved-enlist-e3-tank-mixes&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approved Enlist E3 Tank Mixes*:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enlist One: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.enlist.com/en/approved-tank-mixes/enlist-one.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.enlist.com/en/approved-tank-mixes/enlist-one.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enlist Duo: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.enlist.com/en/approved-tank-mixes/enlist-duo.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.enlist.com/en/approved-tank-mixes/enlist-duo.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Applicators should check websites frequently throughout the growing season to ensure they have the most up to date information regarding approved tank mixes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that a glyphosate, 2,4-D choline and glufosinate tank mix is only permitted with the Enlist One formulation. Glufosinate products are not approved for tank mix with Enlist Duo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that Roundup PowerMAX which is labeled for use in “Roundup Ready Crops” now has a supplemental label for use in Glyphosate-Tolerant Crops such as Enlist E3 soybeans and LLGT27 soybeans in Wisconsin. You can find the labels on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cdms.net/Label-Database&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CDMS label database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;approved-enlist-e3-allowable-nozzles&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approved Enlist E3 Allowable Nozzles:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Enlist Duo: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.enlist.com/en/approved-tank-mixes/enlist-duo-allowable-nozzles.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.enlist.com/en/approved-tank-mixes/enlist-duo-allowable-nozzles.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adopt best management practices and follow label requirements to minimize particle drift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start clean and use an effective PRE-emergence herbicide program*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spray small weeds (4 inches or less) &amp;amp; consider a layered-residual approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large droplet size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the landscape (be aware of sensitive areas and susceptible crops)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow label requirements by the book!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;For assistance with PRE-emergence herbicide selection, check our publication: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/residual-control-of-waterhemp-with-pre-emergence-herbicides-in-soybean/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Residual Control of Waterhemp with PRE-emergence Herbicides in Soybeans&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For further guidance on proper Enlist One and Enlist Duo applications consult the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.enlist.com/en/application-guide.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enlist Herbicides website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;additional-considerations&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Considerations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our low tunnel volatility and large-scale drift trials conducted at UW Arlington Ag Research Station and Sun Prairie, WI have indicated minimal to no injury from 2,4-D choline into non-Enlist soybeans. Check our video from the &lt;strong&gt;2019 large-scale 2,4-D field trial&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//player.vimeo.com/video/357101555&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glufosinate can also be sprayed POST-emergence in Enlist E3 soybeans, which gives farmers an additional chemical option for broadleaf weed control. Check our video &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;getting the most out of glufosinate&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;:
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//player.vimeo.com/video/335011671&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information regarding our 2,4-D and glufosinate efficacy trials check our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/2019-wisconsin-weed-science-research-report/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2019 Wisconsin Weed Science Research Report&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is important to use an integrated weed management approach with multiple strategies (e.g., mix and rotate effective herbicide sites of action, crop rotation, promote good agronomics to hasten canopy closure, incorporate cover crops, use of tillage when appropriate, etc.) to postpone evolution of weed resistance to 2,4-D and glufosinate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Residual Control of Waterhemp with PRE-emergence Herbicides in Soybean</title>
      <link>/post/residual-control-of-waterhemp-with-pre-emergence-herbicides-in-soybean/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Waterhemp management in soybean was challenge for several Wisconsin farmers in 2019. The use of PRE-emergence herbicides is a foundation for effective waterhemp control; however, results from our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/2018-wisconsin-cropping-systems-weed-science-survey/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;2018 weed management survey&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; indicated that the use of a single POST herbicide application is still a common weed control strategy for several farmers in the state. Furthermore, recent research by the UW-Madison Cropping Systems Weed Science Lab revealed that waterhemp resistance to glyphosate (EPSPS; Group 9) and imazethapyr (ALS; Group 2) is widespread across corn and soybean fields in Wisconsin, limiting effective POST herbicide control options, particularly in soybean (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/wisconsin-waterhemp-herbicide-resistance-project-2019-update/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;“Wisconsin Waterhemp Herbicide Resistance Project – 2019 Update”&lt;/a&gt;  for an in depth look at those results).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2018 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/img/2018%20waterhemp%20challenge/Waterhemp%20Management%20PRE%20Comparison_Lancaster%20WI%202018.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;“2018 UW-Waterhemp Challenge: Comparison of Soil Residual Soybean Herbicides”&lt;/a&gt;), and replicated in 2019, a study was conducted to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of multiple PRE-emergence soybean herbicides. This was a joint effort between the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ipcm.wisc.edu/npm/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;UW-Madison Nutrient and Pest Management Program&lt;/a&gt; (NPM; Dan Smith and Richard Proost) and the UW-Madison Cropping Systems Weed Science team. The study was conducted both years at &lt;a href=&#34;https://lancaster.ars.wisc.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;UW Lancaster Ag Research Station&lt;/a&gt;, in Lancaster, WI (Grant Co; Southwest WI) in fields naturally infested with waterhemp. Treatments consisted of PRE-emergence soybean herbicides with one, two, or three different active ingredient(s) and/or site(s) of action (SOA). Herbicide rates tested in this study were selected based on recommendations for a typical WI Silt Loam soil. Herbicides were sprayed within 3 days after soybean planting and visual efficacy data collected at 25 and 50 days after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When selecting a PRE-herbicide program, it is important to balance efficacy and product cost. Always consider soil characteristics, geographic restrictions and crop rotation when determining which products and rates to use in your PRE-emergence herbicide program. The residual activity of a PRE-emergence herbicide is dependent on the rate applied; cutting rates is not a recommended strategy when attempting to manage troublesome weeds like waterhemp. &lt;strong&gt;Always read, understand, and follow the pesticide label.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for additional research updates related to control of waterhemp and other troublesome weeds in Wisconsin as well summer plot tour opportunities in 2020!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take-Home from the “Residual Control of Waterhemp with PRE-emergence Herbicides in Soybean” Publication:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to its genetic variability, wide emergence window, vigorous growth potential, and prolific seed production, waterhemp has become a troublesome weed in soybean cropping systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wisconsin research summarized herein demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating pre-emergence herbicides into waterhemp management programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective herbicide programs should be determined on a field to field basis taking into consideration soil properties, geographic restrictions, subsequent crop(s), and soil seedbank weed species composition, pressure, and presence of herbicide resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustainable management of herbicide-resistant waterhemp populations requires a holistic integrated approach incorporating cultural and/or mechanical practices alongside chemical herbicide programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, don’t let them seed. No seed, no weed!&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Waterhemp management has become a major challenge for several corn and soybean farmers in Wisconsin and beyond. Waterhemp has an extended emergence window and is a competitive, prolific and genetically diverse weed species which has evolved resistance to commonly used corn and soybean herbicides across the Midwest (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/wisconsin-waterhemp-herbicide-resistance-project-2019-update/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2019 Wisconsin Waterhemp Herbicide Resistance Project Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The use of soil residual herbicides is a foundation for waterhemp control and given that several effective and flexible herbicide options in terms of application window (PRE through early-POST) are available for corn, this crop provides farmers with a good opportunity for effective waterhemp management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019 we conducted a study to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of multiple soil-applied corn herbicides. The study was conducted at a grower’s field south of Brooklyn, Dane county, WI in a field with natural and significant waterhemp infestation as part of our &lt;strong&gt;WiscWeeds Waterhemp Management Challenge&lt;/strong&gt; educational efforts. Treatments consisted of corn herbicides containing one or multiple sites of action (SOA). Herbicides were sprayed when corn reached the V2 growth stage. Visual evaluation data on a 0-100% scale (0% indicating no waterhemp control and 100% indicating complete control) were collected at 25 and 50 days after treatment (DAT). Since the objective was to evaluate soil residual activity, Liberty (32 fl oz per acre) was tank-mixed to all treatments to eliminate established waterhemp plants at the time of herbicide application (corn hybrid used in this study was LibertyLink). Two treatments were intentionally applied off-label in this study given their relevance in our state and thus the importance of collecting their soil residual efficacy data: Princep 4FL and Verdict (these products are labeled PRE-emergence only in corn).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To download the 2019 Preliminary Report of the “&lt;strong&gt;WiscWeeds Herbicide Comparison for Residual Waterhemp Control in Corn&lt;/strong&gt;” (PDF file) click &lt;a href=&#34;/img/2019 corn residual/WiscWeeds Herbicide Comparison for Residual Waterhemp Control in Corn.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2019 corn residual/25 dat corn.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;25 DAT&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2019 corn residual/50 dat corn.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;50 DAT&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2019 corn residual/IMG_2766.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Natural Infestation&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The herbicide rates used in the study are ones recommended by our industry colleagues and supported by us for a typical Wisconsin Silt Loam soil. In this report we also include site and study information, and the equivalent rate of single active ingredient products in the premixes evaluated (herbicides with multiple active ingredients). Our intent with this study is not to promote one product versus another, instead, demonstrate the value of using an effective soil residual programs for waterhemp control in corn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;take-home&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take-Home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When selecting a soil-applied herbicide program, we challenge agronomists and farmers to balance efficacy (using our results and their experience), product cost, and rotation restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also encourage farmers to compare their use rates with the ones used in our study (recommended by industry representatives and respective product labels), assuming Silt Loam soils. The residual activity of a soil-applied herbicide is dependent on the rates applied; cutting rates is not a recommended strategy when attempting to manage troublesome weeds like waterhemp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRE-emergence herbicide programs containing multiple effective sites of action are recommended to broaden weed control spectrum and to lower selection for additional herbicide resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When selecting a commercial premix, note that not all active ingredients may be considered effective. For instance, Halex GT contains 3 SOA (glyphosate, Group 9; S-metolachlor, Group 15; mesotrione, Group 27) but only two will provide effective soil residual control for waterhemp (S-metolachlor, Group 15; mesotrione, Group 27).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these results should be taken with a grain of salt (only one year of data), they clearly indicate the value of effective soil residual herbicides. This study will be replicated in 2020. Stay tuned for additional research findings related to our waterhemp control studies and also plot tour opportunities in 2020!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Always read, understand and follow the pesticide label.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Felipe Faleco (UW-Madison Agronomy Graduate Student), &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/dave-stoltenberg/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;David Stoltenberg&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Agronomy Professor), &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/mark-renz/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mark Renz&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Weed Scientist) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Weed Scientist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waterhemp&lt;/strong&gt; is a competitive, prolific and genetically diverse weed species which has evolved resistance to commonly used corn and soybean herbicides across the Midwest. In Wisconsin, waterhemp populations have been confirmed resistant to three sites of action (SOA): ALS (acetolactate synthase; Group 2), EPSPS (enolpyruvyl shikimate phosphate synthase; Group 9), and/or PPO-inhibitor herbicides (protoporphyrinogin oxidase; Group 14). Glyphosate resistance has been confirmed in 28 Wisconsin counties and multiple resistance to glyphosate and PPO-inhibitors has been confirmed in 10 of these counties. For more information on the status of herbicide resistance in Wisconsin click &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/herbicide-resistance-in-wisconsin-an-overview/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the distribution of herbicide resistance in waterhemp to commonly used herbicides is vital for the selection of appropriate management strategies. The &lt;strong&gt;objective&lt;/strong&gt; of this study was to determine the frequency and distribution of glyphosate (EPSPS; Group 9), imazethapyr (ALS; Group 2) and atrazine (photosystem II [PSII]; Group 5)-resistant waterhemp populations in Wisconsin corn and soybean production systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out of 86 waterhemp populations screened, 95% and 70% were confirmed resistant to 1x and 3x label rate of &lt;strong&gt;glyphosate&lt;/strong&gt;, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out of 82 waterhemp populations screened, 98% and 93% were confirmed resistant to 1x and 3x label rate of &lt;strong&gt;imazethapyr&lt;/strong&gt;, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out of 80 waterhemp populations screened, 10% and 3% were confirmed resistant to 1x and 3x label rate of &lt;strong&gt;atrazine&lt;/strong&gt;, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glyphosate and imazethapyr-resistant waterhemp populations are widespread across corn and soybean fields in Wisconsin, requiring awareness and action from stakeholders to mitigate their detrimental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atrazine restrictions in Wisconsin may partially explain the lower than expected resistance frequency. Atrazine resistance in waterhemp populations from other Midwestern states is more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the distribution of waterhemp resistance and selection of effective PRE and POST emergence herbicides can assist growers develop better management strategies and ameliorate the issues with herbicide resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-directions&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Directions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subset of populations will be selected and further studies will be conducted to evaluate the response of these populations to other herbicides applied POST (lactofen, mesotrione, glufosinate, 2,4-D and dicamba) or PRE (atrazine, mesotrione, metribuzin, sulfentrazone and &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;-metolachlor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank the &lt;strong&gt;Wisconsin Soybean Marketing Board&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Wisconsin Corn Promotion Board&lt;/strong&gt; for supporting this project. Many thanks to those who contributed to this project by collecting waterhemp seeds (individual reports to collaborators will be submitted in January 2020). Members of the Wisconsin Cropping Systems Weed Science Lab provided technical assistance towards the execution of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-methods&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;86 waterhemp populations from 27 Wisconsin counties were collected and submitted by stakeholders in the fall of 2018 (many thanks to those who contributed to this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/wisconsin-waterhemp-herbicide-resistance-project/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by collecting waterhemp seeds).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimental units consisted of cone-tainers (656 ml) filled with Pro-Mix HP Mycorrhizae potting mix. Plants were maintained in a greenhouse with a controlled environment, watered daily and fertilized once a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatments were applied when waterhemp plants reached 2-4 inches in height using a single-nozzle research track spray chamber with AI9502EVS nozzle tips, calibrated to deliver 15 GPA of spray solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatments consisted of &lt;strong&gt;glyphosate&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;1X&lt;/strong&gt; = Roundup PowerMax at 22 fl oz/acre and &lt;strong&gt;3X&lt;/strong&gt; = Roundup PowerMax at 66 fl oz/acre), imazethapyr (&lt;strong&gt;1X&lt;/strong&gt; = Pursuit at 4 fl oz/acre and &lt;strong&gt;3X&lt;/strong&gt; = Pursuit at 12 fl oz/acre), atrazine (&lt;strong&gt;1X&lt;/strong&gt;= Aatrex 4L at 2 pts/acre and 3X = Aatrex 4L at 6 pts/acre), and the &lt;strong&gt;nontreated control&lt;/strong&gt;. AMS (2 lbs/acre) was added to the glyphosate treatments. AMS (2 lbs/acre) + COC (0.6% v/v) were added to the imazethapyr treatments. COC (0.8%) v/v was added to the atrazine treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with 8 replications per herbicide treatment and two experimental runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;21 days after treatment (DAT) visual evaluation (VE) of plant growth was taken on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 representing a dead plant and 10 a completely healthy plant, Figure 1) and aboveground biomass harvested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waterhemp populations were considered resistant to each treatment if 50% or more of treated plants between experimental runs had VE ≥ 7 (healthy plants completely capable of reproducing).

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shawn Conley and team &lt;a href=&#34;https://coolbean.info/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;(Coolbean.info)&lt;/a&gt; recently released the 2019 yield data from their soybean variety trials conducted across the state of Wisconsin and concluded that no yield differences were observed across herbicide tolerance traits within nor across regions (Enlist E3, RR2 Xtend and LLGT27):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2020 Soybean HT Survey/2020 Trait Slide Conley.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;small&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we would like to ask Wisconsin soybean producers and decision influencers to help us better understand herbicide tolerance trait and POST-emergence herbicide adoption in 2019 and their plans for 2020. This information will be of great value to our educational efforts during this Extension season and research efforts during 2020 and beyond. The survey has 30 questions and should take less than 10 minutes of your time.

&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist), &lt;strong&gt;Nick Arneson&lt;/strong&gt; (UW-Madison Weed Science Outreach Specialist) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://ipcm.wisc.edu/contacts/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan Smith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (UW NPM Southwest Wisconsin Regional Specialist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though native to Wisconsin, waterhemp has spread like wildfire and become a major problem in agricultural fields across the state in the past few years. In the fall of 2018, stakeholders submitted seed samples from 88 populations from across the state. UW-Madison Agronomy Grad Student Felipe Faleco has screened them for resistance to glyphosate and imazethapyr (Pursuit) and found that more than 90% of the waterhemp populations screened are resistant to both herbicides applied at their respective label rates (Roundup PowerMax at 22 fl oz/acre and Pursuit at 4 fl oz/acre).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combines are very effective weed dispersal agents, moving weed seeds within and across fields. Our objectives with this project are to evaluate: i) how often combines are contaminated with weed seeds, ii) which weed species are common combine contaminants, and iii) the main places within combines weed seeds hide. To participate in the project, please download, print and fill out the collection protocol &lt;a href=&#34;/img/2019 WiscWeeds Coalition/2019 Combine Weed Seed Collection Submission Form.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(click here to download the PDF file)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and watch the brief instruction &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/374533967&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vimeo video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samples must be collected after harvesting a crop field and before combines are winterized. Next spring and summer (2020), samples will be mixed with soil, placed in flats and watered daily in the greenhouse. The number of weeds and species will be recorded and flats will be sprayed with glyphosate when plants are established to evaluate the incidence of glyphosate-resistant weeds. A summary of our research findings will be made available in the Fall of 2020. We thank you in advance for your interest and participation in this collaborative project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wiscweeds-research-coalition-about&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WiscWeeds Research Coalition - About:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the widespread occurrence of herbicide-resistant weeds across Wisconsin Cropping Systems, the shortage of novel herbicide sites of action, and the socioeconomic and environmental challenges herbicide-resistant weeds bring to farming operations and communities, it’s time for our industry to come together and work towards a similar goal: to promote and hopefully achieve effective and sustainable weed control in crop production systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of the WiscWeeds Research Coalition is to bring together Researchers, Educators, Policy Makers, Industry, Consultants, Service Providers, and Growers to work towards preventing the spread, reducing the selection for, and to increase the adoption of integrated management strategies to combat herbicide-resistant weed species. Through the WiscWeeds Research Coalition we expect to develop a strong relationship amongst key stakeholders allowing for effective exchange of materials, practical knowledge and research-based recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marestail (aka horseweed) tends to be a troublesome weed species in no-till cropping systems across the Midwest and this year we received several inquiries regarding poor marestail control in parts of Wisconsin. Thus, we would like to invite Wisconsin farmers, crop consultants, educators and industry representatives that are dealing with this weed to collect seeds this fall from their row crop production fields and submit them to UW-Madison for herbicide resistance screenings (please collect marestail seed samples from fields with consistent infestation levels).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We intend to screen samples in the greenhouse for resistance to glyphosate (Group 9), PPO-inhibitor (e.g., Cobra, Flextar, Cadet; Group 14), ALS-inhibitor (e.g., Pursuit, Classic, FirstRate; Group 2), and Growth Regulator (e.g., dicamba, 2,4-D; Group 4) herbicides. Results will be made available to those who submit the samples after the greenhouse screenings are completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no cost associated to the herbicide resistance screening. The only cost will be your time to collect the seed samples and mailing them to: &lt;strong&gt;Rodrigo Werle, 1575 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please download and print the &lt;a href=&#34;/img/2019 marestail seed collection/2019 WiscWeeds Marestail Seed Project.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEED COLLECTION FORM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (PDF file) for information on how to collect the seeds and fill out the information necessary for the project. Please submit the form with the seed sample. Samples will only be included in the herbicide resistance screening if the information requested herein is provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For questions, contact Dr. Rodrigo Werle via e-mail: &lt;strong&gt;rwerle@wisc.edu&lt;/strong&gt; or phone: &lt;strong&gt;608-262-7130&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thank the &lt;strong&gt;Wisconsin Soybean Marketing Board&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;United Soybean Board&lt;/strong&gt; for providing partial funding to support this project and also those submitting samples.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Puckered soybeans and uncontrolled pigweeds… The thoughts of a young weed scientist</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I took a group of UW-Madison Graduate Students to participate in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ncwss.org/weed-contest/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2019 North American Weed Science Contest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Seymour, IL (July 24-26, 2019). Driving through the Interstate (I-74/I-39), Highways and country side, the off-target herbicide movement (puckered/cupped soybeans) and waterhemp pressure across central IL were evident. Thus, I would like to use this IL scenario as my “case study” for this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2019 dicamba pigweed/IMG_3926.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. Soybean field in central Illinois injured by off-target dicamba movement. Picture taken on 07/25/2019.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I stopped at some of the “puckered/cupped” IL soybean fields, something else got my attention, the unsatisfactory control of waterhemp in several fields that I assume were Liberty Link treated POST-emergence with glufosinate (a couple were for sure because I got to talk with the growers). While the lack of complete waterhemp control with glufosinate is often associated to non-ideal application conditions (e.g., weed size, spray coverage, environmental conditions, etc.), we have to keep in mind that waterhemp and Palmer amaranth are genetically diverse and adapt rather quickly, and the picture below I believe does a good job illustrating the genetic diversity/adaptation ability of waterhemp (Figure 2). As of today, no waterhemp nor Palmer amaranth populations in the US have been confirmed resistant to glufosinate, but I hypothesize it will not take long for that to happen. Lack of complete waterhemp and Palmer amaranth control with dicamba has also been reported in different parts of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2019 dicamba pigweed/IMG_3960.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Differential response of waterhemp to POST-emergence glufosinate application. Plants were all collected within a 20-yard radius in the same soybean field. Picture taken in central Illinois on 07/25/2019.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, the off-target dicamba movement is definitely a big problem and we need to overcome that if dicamba continues to be a part of weed control in soybeans moving forward; however, the culprit of it all is &lt;strong&gt;waterhemp&lt;/strong&gt; in the Midwest and &lt;strong&gt;Palmer amaranth&lt;/strong&gt; in the MidSouth (and parts of the Midwest too). Remember, they are the reason why our growers are spraying dicamba in soybeans. While dicamba off-target movement is turning neighbors, industry and academics against each other, these weeds keep on adapting and we should be, more than ever, all working together towards addressing the challenge that they are posing in our cropping systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A frustration shared with me by a Liberty Link soybean farmer in central IL was that after being “hit” by dicamba for 3 years in a row he will switch to Xtend soybeans in 2020 to protect himself, and that it unacceptable (we all have heard similar stories by now). The traits must be able to coexist (conventional, RR2Y, LL, LLGT27, Xtend, Enlist), and that will only happen if we change our weed management mentality and particularly the way/timing we spray our POST-emergence herbicides. Moreover, trait coexistence is necessary so technologies can be rotated, lowering the selection pressure for additional herbicide resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts on how to reduce off-target dicamba movement:&lt;/strong&gt; when used POST-emergence in soybeans, dicamba should be sprayed early in the season and not as a “rescue” program right before soybeans flower (from conversations with stakeholders, this is how dicamba is being currently used in most Xtend soybean cropping systems). Applications should be made by the book (according to the label) and only under appropriate environmental conditions (no temperature inversion; temperatures below 80-85F during and for two days after application; wind constantly blowing towards non-sensitive areas during and for two days after application [&amp;gt;3mph]). In collaboration with other Universities and Industry, my research program has and will continue to investigate strategies and technologies that can help minimize dicamba off-target movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2019 dicamba pigweed/IMG_3972.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;3&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. Puckered soybeans (left), Xtend soybeans (right) and the culprit in the center (waterhemp). Picture taken in central Illinois on 07/25/2019.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When driving through some corn fields in IL, it’s evident that some growers aren’t as concerned about waterhemp in corn. That’s a similar story in Wisconsin and many other states. One just can’t see the waterhemp in corn from the road in July/August driving at 50 mph or faster. In corn years, growers have several effective herbicide options for waterhemp and Palmer amaranth control, and all efforts should be made not to let these weeds go to seed, which will facilitate weed control in subsequent soybean seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, from my travels across the Midwest, it’s evident that weed pressure is higher in headlands/field edges (Figure 4) and I challenge growers to apply more aggressive weed control strategies in these parts of their fields (e.g., additional soil residual herbicides, cover crops, hand weeding, etc.). I intend to write a grant proposal with colleagues across the country this fall and hope to work with growers to evaluate the value of intensified weed control in headland/field margins towards their overall weed control success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2019 dicamba pigweed/IMG_3918.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;4&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. Waterhemp infesting the margins of a corn field in central Illinois. Picture taken on 07/25/2019.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption of integrated weed management strategies (e.g., tillage, enhanced crop competition via agronomic cultural practices, cover crops, diversified crop rotations, diversified herbicide mixing and rotations, hand-weeding [ZERO-TOLERANCE approach], etc.) is more than ever a necessity. As a community, we need to continue to think outside the jug so the jugs remain effective and available as we move forward. I hope to be making sense here, provoking some thoughts and not insulting anyone. As a young Extension Weed Scientist it’s disheartening to see farmers against farmers during field days and academics against academics during scientific gatherings due to a “side effect” generated by a problem that is not currently the center of the attention, but should be (&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Management of Waterhemp and Palmer amaranth&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herein I used IL for my case study; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cropsciences.illinois.edu/people/profile/hager&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Aaron Hager&lt;/a&gt; is the Extension Weed Specialist at the University of Illinois. Thanks to my mentors for valuable feedback towards this article.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Can brand or generic herbicides be tank-mixed? Part-3 (we keep learning!) </title>
      <link>/post/can-brand-or-generic-herbicides-be-tank-mixed-part-3-we-keep-learning/</link>

      <guid>/post/can-brand-or-generic-herbicides-be-tank-mixed-part-3-we-keep-learning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I released a blog post attempting to address the question regarding tank mixing safened S-metolachlor/metolachlor, atrazine and/or mesotrione-based products for weed control in corn (see: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/can-brand-or-generic-herbicides-be-tank-mixed-part-2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Can brand or generic herbicides be tank-mixed? Part-2&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mesotrione products that I checked during my label search (i.e., Callisto, Explorer, Mesotrione 4SC and Meso Star) stated the following restriction: &lt;em&gt;“DO NOT apply this product post-emergence in a tank mix with emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides, unless specifically directed under one of the tank mix section of this label, or crop injury can occur”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safened S-metolachlor products such as Duall II Magnum, Medal EC and Brawl, and safened metolachlor products such as Me-Too-Lachlor II and Stalwart C labeled for use in corn fall under the &lt;strong&gt;emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides&lt;/strong&gt; formulation category and thus &lt;strong&gt;SHOULD NOT&lt;/strong&gt; be tank-mixed with the &lt;strong&gt;aforementioned&lt;/strong&gt; mesotrione products for POST-emergence applications in corn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOWEVER&lt;/strong&gt;, there are several safened S-metolachlor/metolachlor and mesotrione products out there and of course I missed checking the label of some. This week I received calls from chemical retailers in Wisconsin mentioning that my blog post was not completely accurate. Guess what? They were right. I even stated the following in the previous article &lt;em&gt;“Once this post is released there will likely be a “Part 3” coming next because I will certainly forget to address something important; going through the label exercise is not a simple task! That’s when experience comes into play. Growers should always consult an expert before spraying a custom herbicide tank mix. Always read the product label before spraying.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the feedback I received, Drexel Chemical Company has a mesotrione product called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drexchem.com/products/mesotryone-4l-2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MesoTryOne 4L&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In their &lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.agrian.com/pdfs/Drexel1a_MesoTryOne_4L_Label.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;label&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (page 2), instead of having the particular tank mix being discussed herein under &lt;strong&gt;RESTRICTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;, they have it under &lt;strong&gt;USE PRECAUTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“Post-emergence applications of this product in tank-mixes with emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides may cause severe corn injury or yield loss under adverse weather conditions”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in this case, the tank mixing of an emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicide with MesoTryOne 4L POST-emergence in corn is considered a legal application; however, the label states that you must apply under “non-adverse weather conditions” to reduce the potential of crop injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go to &lt;em&gt;“Table 5. Tank-mixtures of this Product for PRE-emergence Application in Corn”&lt;/em&gt; (page 9 of the MesoTryOne 4L label), you will see that the mixture of MesoTryOne 4L with Metolachlor (e.g., Me-Too-Lachlor II, Duall II Magnum) is listed; but the same tank mixture is not listed in &lt;em&gt;“Table 6. Tank-mixtures of this Product for Post-emergence Application in Corn”&lt;/em&gt; (page 9 of the label). Moreover, the tank mixture of commercial pre-mixes of Atrazine + Metolachlor (e.g., Trizmet, Bicep II Magnum) with MesoTryOne 4L are listed in Table 6,  but keep in mind that these pre-mixes are formulated as a suspension concentrate. The concern regarding crop injury comes from having mesotrione tank mixed and sprayed POST-emergence with emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly appreciate the positive criticism and feedback from the clientele and industry colleagues! Though my post was not 100% accurate, I certainly got folks to take a closer look at the labels (mission accomplished!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, going through the label exercise is not a simple task! That’s when experience comes into play. Growers should always consult an expert before spraying a custom herbicide tank mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: I am not endorsing Drexel Chemical Company and the use of their product MesoTryone 4L (nor the opposite). I am just using their product as a pertinent example for the discussions regarding custom herbicide tank mixtures and label restrictions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always read the product label before spraying.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Can brand or generic herbicides be tank-mixed? Part-2</title>
      <link>/post/can-brand-or-generic-herbicides-be-tank-mixed-part-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/can-brand-or-generic-herbicides-be-tank-mixed-part-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month we released a blog post entitled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/can-brand-or-generic-herbicides-be-tank-mixed/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Can brand or generic herbicides be tank-mixed?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and in the first paragraph we wrote &lt;em&gt;“This past week we received several questions regarding herbicide tank mixtures. One common question was whether brand and/or generic S-metolachlor/metolachlor, atrazine and/or mesotrione-based products could be tank-mixed”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After speaking with industry colleagues, I learned that in the original blog post we described several important aspects to consider when developing a custom herbicide tank mix but did not actually answer if S-metolachlor/safened metolachlor, atrazine and/or mesotrione-based products could be tank-mixed; herein I will attempt to address this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, the answer is &lt;strong&gt;“it depends”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lumax EZ is a popular pre-mix corn herbicide that contains S-metolachlor, atrazine and mesotrione. Lumax EZ herbicide can be sprayed PRE and early-POST in corn (according to the label: &lt;em&gt;“Postemergence applications to field corn must be made before crop reaches 12 inches in height”&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a grower decides to make his/her own “Lumax-equivalent” custom tank mix, that tank mix can be sprayed before corn emergence. After corn emergence, there is a caveat to be considered; the label of mesotrione-based products such as Callisto, Explorer, Mesotrione 4SC and Meso Star state the following restriction: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“DO NOT apply this product post-emergence in a tank mix with emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides, unless specifically directed under one of the tank mix section of this label, or crop injury can occur”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S-metolachlor-based products such as Duall II Magnum, Medal EC and Brawl, and safened metolachlor-based products such as Me-Too-Lachlor and Stalwart C labeled for use in corn fall under the &lt;strong&gt;emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides&lt;/strong&gt; formulation category and thus &lt;strong&gt;SHOULD NOT&lt;/strong&gt; be tank-mixed with the aforementioned mesotrione-based products for POST-emergence applications in corn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&amp;amp;A:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can S-metolachlor/safened metolachlor be tank-mixed with atrazine and sprayed POST-emergence in corn? &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can mesotrione be tank-mixed with atrazine and sprayed POST-emergence in corn? &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can S-metolachlor/safened metolachlor be tank-mixed with mesotrione and sprayed POST-emergence in corn? &lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can S-metolachlor/safened metolachlor, atrazine and mesotrione be tank-mixed and sprayed POST-emergence in corn? &lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, pay attention to the: i) geographic restrictions (for instance atrazine use is prohibited in parts of Wisconsin), ii) maximum use rate of a pesticide per application and iii) total pesticide use within a season. Always follow the most restrictive tank mix instructions for the products involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check our 2018 post &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/geographic-restrictions-for-corn-and-soybean-pre-emergence-herbicides-in-wisconsin/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Geographic Restrictions for Corn and Soybean PRE-emergence Herbicides in Wisconsin”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for additional geographic restriction information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this post is released there will likely be a “Part 3” coming next because I will certainly forget to address something important; going through the label exercise is not a simple task! That’s when experience comes into play. Growers should always consult an expert before spraying a custom herbicide tank mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always read the product label before spraying.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Nick Arneson (UW-Madison Weed Science Outreach Specialist), David Wang (UW-Madison Undergraduate Research Scholar) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the growing interest in producing industrial hemp in Wisconsin and beyond, it is important to pay close attention to rotation interval restrictions when planting this crop in conventional production fields where herbicides are adopted. Though no synthetic herbicides are labeled for weed control in industrial hemp in the United States at this time, it’s important to keep in mind that herbicides sprayed in previous crops can have an impact on the industrial hemp crop establishment and development. Moreover, the pesticide label is the law and should be followed accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below you will find a comprehensive list of herbicides commonly used in corn-soybean rotations and their respective plant rotation restrictions (in months after application) for industrial hemp planting according to their respective labels. Note that the most restrictive interval for each product is listed below (for some products the rotation restriction may be shorter depending upon rate used, geography, soil pH, annual precipitation, etc.; please double check the label). Since industrial hemp is a new crop and thus not part of current label languages, its rotational restrictions fall under “other crops” when searching for this information in the product labels. See video &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/333384395&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Weed Talk: 2019 Industrial Hemp Herbicide Carryover Considerations”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotation Restrictions Before Planting Industrial Hemp (in Months After Application):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Cadet, Cobra, Glyphosate 4 Plus, Glyphosate 5.4, Gramoxone SL 2.0, Roundup PowerMAX&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 month&lt;/strong&gt; = Fusilade DX, Resource, Select Max&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.5 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Harmony SG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 months&lt;/strong&gt; = 2,4-D (e.g., 2,4-D Amine, Barrage HF, Salvo, Shredder 2,4-D LV4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Assure II, dicamba (e.g., Clarity, Engenia, Fexapan, Status, XtendiMax)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Liberty 280&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Confidence, Harness, Outlook, Sharpen, Verdict, Warrant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Aim, Authority Elite, Boundary, Cinch, Command 3ME, Dual II Magnum, Parallel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Anthem, Anthem Maxx, Armezon, Authority MTZ, Balance Flexx, Basis Blend, Beacon, Callisto, Callisto GT, Corvus, Dimetric DF 75%, FirstRate, Halex GT, Impact, Instigate, Lumax EZ, Prefix, Prequel, Raptor, Require Q, Resolve DF, Resolve Q, Resolve SG, Rowel, Solstice, Spirit, Valor SX, Valor EZ, Vise, Zemax, Zidua, Zidua SC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Prowl H2O&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Hornet, SureStart II, TripleFLEX&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Authority Assist, Authority First, Canopy, Classic, Enlite, Envive, Rowel FX, Sonic, Synchrony, Trivence, Valor XLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Authority Maxx, Authority XL, Permit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;40 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Extreme, Optill, Optill PRO, Pursuit, Torment&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will soon release an in-detail publication with additional information on how herbicide rates and soil characteristics influence rotational Industrial Hemp crop restrictions. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always read, understand and follow the pesticide label.&lt;/p&gt;
