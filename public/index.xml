&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist), &lt;strong&gt;Nick Arneson&lt;/strong&gt; (UW-Madison Weed Science Outreach Specialist0,) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://ipcm.wisc.edu/contacts/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan Smith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (UW NPM Southwest Wisconsin Regional Specialist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though native to Wisconsin, waterhemp has spread like wildfire and become a major problem in agricultural fields across the state in the past few years. In the fall of 2018, stakeholders submitted seed samples from 88 populations from across the state. UW-Madison Agronomy Grad Student Felipe Faleco has screened them for resistance to glyphosate and imazethapyr (Pursuit) and found that more than 90% of the waterhemp populations screened are resistant to both herbicides applied at their respective label rates (Roundup PowerMax at 22 fl oz/acre and Pursuit at 4 fl oz/acre).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combines are very effective weed dispersal agents, moving weed seeds within and across fields. Our objectives with this project are to evaluate: i) how often combines are contaminated with weed seeds, ii) which weed species are common combine contaminants, and iii) the main places within combines weed seeds hide. To participate in the project, please download, print and fill out the collection protocol &lt;a href=&#34;/img/2019 WiscWeeds Coalition/2019 Combine Weed Seed Collection Submission Form.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(click here to download the PDF file)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and watch the brief instruction &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/374533967&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vimeo video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samples must be collected after harvesting a crop field and before combines are winterized. Next spring and summer (2020), samples will be mixed with soil, placed in flats and watered daily in the greenhouse. The number of weeds and species will be recorded and flats will be sprayed with glyphosate when plants are established to evaluate the incidence of glyphosate-resistant weeds. A summary of our research findings will be made available in the Fall of 2020. We thank you in advance for your interest and participation in this collaborative project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wiscweeds-research-coalition-about&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WiscWeeds Research Coalition - About:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the widespread occurrence of herbicide-resistant weeds across Wisconsin Cropping Systems, the shortage of novel herbicide sites of action, and the socioeconomic and environmental challenges herbicide-resistant weeds bring to farming operations and communities, it’s time for our industry to come together and work towards a similar goal: to promote and hopefully achieve effective and sustainable weed control in crop production systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of the WiscWeeds Research Coalition is to bring together Researchers, Educators, Policy Makers, Industry, Consultants, Service Providers, and Growers to work towards preventing the spread, reducing the selection for, and to increase the adoption of integrated management strategies to combat herbicide-resistant weed species. Through the WiscWeeds Research Coalition we expect to develop a strong relationship amongst key stakeholders allowing for effective exchange of materials, practical knowledge and research-based recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marestail (aka horseweed) tends to be a troublesome weed species in no-till cropping systems across the Midwest and this year we received several inquiries regarding poor marestail control in parts of Wisconsin. Thus, we would like to invite Wisconsin farmers, crop consultants, educators and industry representatives that are dealing with this weed to collect seeds this fall from their row crop production fields and submit them to UW-Madison for herbicide resistance screenings (please collect marestail seed samples from fields with consistent infestation levels).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We intend to screen samples in the greenhouse for resistance to glyphosate (Group 9), PPO-inhibitor (e.g., Cobra, Flextar, Cadet; Group 14), ALS-inhibitor (e.g., Pursuit, Classic, FirstRate; Group 2), and Growth Regulator (e.g., dicamba, 2,4-D; Group 4) herbicides. Results will be made available to those who submit the samples after the greenhouse screenings are completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no cost associated to the herbicide resistance screening. The only cost will be your time to collect the seed samples and mailing them to: &lt;strong&gt;Rodrigo Werle, 1575 Linden Drive, Madison, WI 53706.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please download and print the &lt;a href=&#34;/img/2019 marestail seed collection/2019 WiscWeeds Marestail Seed Project.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEED COLLECTION FORM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (PDF file) for information on how to collect the seeds and fill out the information necessary for the project. Please submit the form with the seed sample. Samples will only be included in the herbicide resistance screening if the information requested herein is provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For questions, contact Dr. Rodrigo Werle via e-mail: &lt;strong&gt;rwerle@wisc.edu&lt;/strong&gt; or phone: &lt;strong&gt;608-262-7130&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thank the &lt;strong&gt;Wisconsin Soybean Marketing Board&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;United Soybean Board&lt;/strong&gt; for providing partial funding to support this project and also those submitting samples.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Puckered soybeans and uncontrolled pigweeds… The thoughts of a young weed scientist</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I took a group of UW-Madison Graduate Students to participate in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ncwss.org/weed-contest/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2019 North American Weed Science Contest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Seymour, IL (July 24-26, 2019). Driving through the Interstate (I-74/I-39), Highways and country side, the off-target herbicide movement (puckered/cupped soybeans) and waterhemp pressure across central IL were evident. Thus, I would like to use this IL scenario as my “case study” for this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2019 dicamba pigweed/IMG_3926.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. Soybean field in central Illinois injured by off-target dicamba movement. Picture taken on 07/25/2019.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I stopped at some of the “puckered/cupped” IL soybean fields, something else got my attention, the unsatisfactory control of waterhemp in several fields that I assume were Liberty Link treated POST-emergence with glufosinate (a couple were for sure because I got to talk with the growers). While the lack of complete waterhemp control with glufosinate is often associated to non-ideal application conditions (e.g., weed size, spray coverage, environmental conditions, etc.), we have to keep in mind that waterhemp and Palmer amaranth are genetically diverse and adapt rather quickly, and the picture below I believe does a good job illustrating the genetic diversity/adaptation ability of waterhemp (Figure 2). As of today, no waterhemp nor Palmer amaranth populations in the US have been confirmed resistant to glufosinate, but I hypothesize it will not take long for that to happen. Lack of complete waterhemp and Palmer amaranth control with dicamba has also been reported in different parts of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2019 dicamba pigweed/IMG_3960.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Differential response of waterhemp to POST-emergence glufosinate application. Plants were all collected within a 20-yard radius in the same soybean field. Picture taken in central Illinois on 07/25/2019.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, the off-target dicamba movement is definitely a big problem and we need to overcome that if dicamba continues to be a part of weed control in soybeans moving forward; however, the culprit of it all is &lt;strong&gt;waterhemp&lt;/strong&gt; in the Midwest and &lt;strong&gt;Palmer amaranth&lt;/strong&gt; in the MidSouth (and parts of the Midwest too). Remember, they are the reason why our growers are spraying dicamba in soybeans. While dicamba off-target movement is turning neighbors, industry and academics against each other, these weeds keep on adapting and we should be, more than ever, all working together towards addressing the challenge that they are posing in our cropping systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A frustration shared with me by a Liberty Link soybean farmer in central IL was that after being “hit” by dicamba for 3 years in a row he will switch to Xtend soybeans in 2020 to protect himself, and that it unacceptable (we all have heard similar stories by now). The traits must be able to coexist (conventional, RR2Y, LL, LLGT27, Xtend, Enlist), and that will only happen if we change our weed management mentality and particularly the way/timing we spray our POST-emergence herbicides. Moreover, trait coexistence is necessary so technologies can be rotated, lowering the selection pressure for additional herbicide resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts on how to reduce off-target dicamba movement:&lt;/strong&gt; when used POST-emergence in soybeans, dicamba should be sprayed early in the season and not as a “rescue” program right before soybeans flower (from conversations with stakeholders, this is how dicamba is being currently used in most Xtend soybean cropping systems). Applications should be made by the book (according to the label) and only under appropriate environmental conditions (no temperature inversion; temperatures below 80-85F during and for two days after application; wind constantly blowing towards non-sensitive areas during and for two days after application [&amp;gt;3mph]). In collaboration with other Universities and Industry, my research program has and will continue to investigate strategies and technologies that can help minimize dicamba off-target movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2019 dicamba pigweed/IMG_3972.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;3&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. Puckered soybeans (left), Xtend soybeans (right) and the culprit in the center (waterhemp). Picture taken in central Illinois on 07/25/2019.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When driving through some corn fields in IL, it’s evident that some growers aren’t as concerned about waterhemp in corn. That’s a similar story in Wisconsin and many other states. One just can’t see the waterhemp in corn from the road in July/August driving at 50 mph or faster. In corn years, growers have several effective herbicide options for waterhemp and Palmer amaranth control, and all efforts should be made not to let these weeds go to seed, which will facilitate weed control in subsequent soybean seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, from my travels across the Midwest, it’s evident that weed pressure is higher in headlands/field edges (Figure 4) and I challenge growers to apply more aggressive weed control strategies in these parts of their fields (e.g., additional soil residual herbicides, cover crops, hand weeding, etc.). I intend to write a grant proposal with colleagues across the country this fall and hope to work with growers to evaluate the value of intensified weed control in headland/field margins towards their overall weed control success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2019 dicamba pigweed/IMG_3918.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;4&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. Waterhemp infesting the margins of a corn field in central Illinois. Picture taken on 07/25/2019.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption of integrated weed management strategies (e.g., tillage, enhanced crop competition via agronomic cultural practices, cover crops, diversified crop rotations, diversified herbicide mixing and rotations, hand-weeding [ZERO-TOLERANCE approach], etc.) is more than ever a necessity. As a community, we need to continue to think outside the jug so the jugs remain effective and available as we move forward. I hope to be making sense here, provoking some thoughts and not insulting anyone. As a young Extension Weed Scientist it’s disheartening to see farmers against farmers during field days and academics against academics during scientific gatherings due to a “side effect” generated by a problem that is not currently the center of the attention, but should be (&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Management of Waterhemp and Palmer amaranth&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herein I used IL for my case study; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cropsciences.illinois.edu/people/profile/hager&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Aaron Hager&lt;/a&gt; is the Extension Weed Specialist at the University of Illinois. Thanks to my mentors for valuable feedback towards this article.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Can brand or generic herbicides be tank-mixed? Part-3 (we keep learning!) </title>
      <link>/post/can-brand-or-generic-herbicides-be-tank-mixed-part-3-we-keep-learning/</link>

      <guid>/post/can-brand-or-generic-herbicides-be-tank-mixed-part-3-we-keep-learning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I released a blog post attempting to address the question regarding tank mixing safened S-metolachlor/metolachlor, atrazine and/or mesotrione-based products for weed control in corn (see: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/can-brand-or-generic-herbicides-be-tank-mixed-part-2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Can brand or generic herbicides be tank-mixed? Part-2&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mesotrione products that I checked during my label search (i.e., Callisto, Explorer, Mesotrione 4SC and Meso Star) stated the following restriction: &lt;em&gt;“DO NOT apply this product post-emergence in a tank mix with emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides, unless specifically directed under one of the tank mix section of this label, or crop injury can occur”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safened S-metolachlor products such as Duall II Magnum, Medal EC and Brawl, and safened metolachlor products such as Me-Too-Lachlor II and Stalwart C labeled for use in corn fall under the &lt;strong&gt;emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides&lt;/strong&gt; formulation category and thus &lt;strong&gt;SHOULD NOT&lt;/strong&gt; be tank-mixed with the &lt;strong&gt;aforementioned&lt;/strong&gt; mesotrione products for POST-emergence applications in corn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOWEVER&lt;/strong&gt;, there are several safened S-metolachlor/metolachlor and mesotrione products out there and of course I missed checking the label of some. This week I received calls from chemical retailers in Wisconsin mentioning that my blog post was not completely accurate. Guess what? They were right. I even stated the following in the previous article &lt;em&gt;“Once this post is released there will likely be a “Part 3” coming next because I will certainly forget to address something important; going through the label exercise is not a simple task! That’s when experience comes into play. Growers should always consult an expert before spraying a custom herbicide tank mix. Always read the product label before spraying.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the feedback I received, Drexel Chemical Company has a mesotrione product called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.drexchem.com/products/mesotryone-4l-2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MesoTryOne 4L&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In their &lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.agrian.com/pdfs/Drexel1a_MesoTryOne_4L_Label.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;label&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (page 2), instead of having the particular tank mix being discussed herein under &lt;strong&gt;RESTRICTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;, they have it under &lt;strong&gt;USE PRECAUTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“Post-emergence applications of this product in tank-mixes with emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides may cause severe corn injury or yield loss under adverse weather conditions”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in this case, the tank mixing of an emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicide with MesoTryOne 4L POST-emergence in corn is considered a legal application; however, the label states that you must apply under “non-adverse weather conditions” to reduce the potential of crop injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go to &lt;em&gt;“Table 5. Tank-mixtures of this Product for PRE-emergence Application in Corn”&lt;/em&gt; (page 9 of the MesoTryOne 4L label), you will see that the mixture of MesoTryOne 4L with Metolachlor (e.g., Me-Too-Lachlor II, Duall II Magnum) is listed; but the same tank mixture is not listed in &lt;em&gt;“Table 6. Tank-mixtures of this Product for Post-emergence Application in Corn”&lt;/em&gt; (page 9 of the label). Moreover, the tank mixture of commercial pre-mixes of Atrazine + Metolachlor (e.g., Trizmet, Bicep II Magnum) with MesoTryOne 4L are listed in Table 6,  but keep in mind that these pre-mixes are formulated as a suspension concentrate. The concern regarding crop injury comes from having mesotrione tank mixed and sprayed POST-emergence with emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly appreciate the positive criticism and feedback from the clientele and industry colleagues! Though my post was not 100% accurate, I certainly got folks to take a closer look at the labels (mission accomplished!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, going through the label exercise is not a simple task! That’s when experience comes into play. Growers should always consult an expert before spraying a custom herbicide tank mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: I am not endorsing Drexel Chemical Company and the use of their product MesoTryone 4L (nor the opposite). I am just using their product as a pertinent example for the discussions regarding custom herbicide tank mixtures and label restrictions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always read the product label before spraying.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Can brand or generic herbicides be tank-mixed? Part-2</title>
      <link>/post/can-brand-or-generic-herbicides-be-tank-mixed-part-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/can-brand-or-generic-herbicides-be-tank-mixed-part-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month we released a blog post entitled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/can-brand-or-generic-herbicides-be-tank-mixed/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Can brand or generic herbicides be tank-mixed?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and in the first paragraph we wrote &lt;em&gt;“This past week we received several questions regarding herbicide tank mixtures. One common question was whether brand and/or generic S-metolachlor/metolachlor, atrazine and/or mesotrione-based products could be tank-mixed”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After speaking with industry colleagues, I learned that in the original blog post we described several important aspects to consider when developing a custom herbicide tank mix but did not actually answer if S-metolachlor/safened metolachlor, atrazine and/or mesotrione-based products could be tank-mixed; herein I will attempt to address this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, the answer is &lt;strong&gt;“it depends”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lumax EZ is a popular pre-mix corn herbicide that contains S-metolachlor, atrazine and mesotrione. Lumax EZ herbicide can be sprayed PRE and early-POST in corn (according to the label: &lt;em&gt;“Postemergence applications to field corn must be made before crop reaches 12 inches in height”&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a grower decides to make his/her own “Lumax-equivalent” custom tank mix, that tank mix can be sprayed before corn emergence. After corn emergence, there is a caveat to be considered; the label of mesotrione-based products such as Callisto, Explorer, Mesotrione 4SC and Meso Star state the following restriction: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“DO NOT apply this product post-emergence in a tank mix with emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides, unless specifically directed under one of the tank mix section of this label, or crop injury can occur”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S-metolachlor-based products such as Duall II Magnum, Medal EC and Brawl, and safened metolachlor-based products such as Me-Too-Lachlor and Stalwart C labeled for use in corn fall under the &lt;strong&gt;emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides&lt;/strong&gt; formulation category and thus &lt;strong&gt;SHOULD NOT&lt;/strong&gt; be tank-mixed with the aforementioned mesotrione-based products for POST-emergence applications in corn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&amp;amp;A:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can S-metolachlor/safened metolachlor be tank-mixed with atrazine and sprayed POST-emergence in corn? &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can mesotrione be tank-mixed with atrazine and sprayed POST-emergence in corn? &lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can S-metolachlor/safened metolachlor be tank-mixed with mesotrione and sprayed POST-emergence in corn? &lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can S-metolachlor/safened metolachlor, atrazine and mesotrione be tank-mixed and sprayed POST-emergence in corn? &lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, pay attention to the: i) geographic restrictions (for instance atrazine use is prohibited in parts of Wisconsin), ii) maximum use rate of a pesticide per application and iii) total pesticide use within a season. Always follow the most restrictive tank mix instructions for the products involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this post is released there will likely be a “Part 3” coming next because I will certainly forget to address something important; going through the label exercise is not a simple task! That’s when experience comes into play. Growers should always consult an expert before spraying a custom herbicide tank mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always read the product label before spraying.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By Nick Arneson (UW-Madison Weed Science Outreach Specialist), David Wang (UW-Madison Undergraduate Research Scholar) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the growing interest in producing industrial hemp in Wisconsin and beyond, it is important to pay close attention to rotation interval restrictions when planting this crop in conventional production fields where herbicides are adopted. Though no synthetic herbicides are labeled for weed control in industrial hemp in the United States at this time, it’s important to keep in mind that herbicides sprayed in previous crops can have an impact on the industrial hemp crop establishment and development. Moreover, the pesticide label is the law and should be followed accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below you will find a comprehensive list of herbicides commonly used in corn-soybean rotations and their respective plant rotation restrictions (in months after application) for industrial hemp planting according to their respective labels. Note that the most restrictive interval for each product is listed below (for some products the rotation restriction may be shorter depending upon rate used, geography, soil pH, annual precipitation, etc.; please double check the label). Since industrial hemp is a new crop and thus not part of current label languages, its rotational restrictions fall under “other crops” when searching for this information in the product labels. See video &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/333384395&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Weed Talk: 2019 Industrial Hemp Herbicide Carryover Considerations”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotation Restrictions Before Planting Industrial Hemp (in Months After Application):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Cadet, Cobra, Glyphosate 4 Plus, Glyphosate 5.4, Gramoxone SL 2.0, Roundup PowerMAX&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 month&lt;/strong&gt; = Fusilade DX, Resource, Select Max&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.5 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Harmony SG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 months&lt;/strong&gt; = 2,4-D (e.g., 2,4-D Amine, Barrage HF, Salvo, Shredder 2,4-D LV4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Assure II, dicamba (e.g., Clarity, Engenia, Fexapan, Status, XtendiMax)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Liberty 280&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Confidence, Harness, Outlook, Sharpen, Verdict, Warrant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Aim, Authority Elite, Boundary, Cinch, Command 3ME, Dual II Magnum, Parallel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Anthem, Anthem Maxx, Armezon, Authority MTZ, Balance Flexx, Basis Blend, Beacon, Callisto, Callisto GT, Corvus, Dimetric DF 75%, FirstRate, Halex GT, Impact, Instigate, Lumax EZ, Prefix, Prequel, Raptor, Require Q, Resolve DF, Resolve Q, Resolve SG, Rowel, Solstice, Spirit, Valor SX, Valor EZ, Vise, Zemax, Zidua, Zidua SC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Prowl H2O&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Hornet, SureStart II, TripleFLEX&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Authority Assist, Authority First, Canopy, Classic, Enlite, Envive, Rowel FX, Sonic, Synchrony, Trivence, Valor XLT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Authority Maxx, Authority XL, Permit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;40 months&lt;/strong&gt; = Extreme, Optill, Optill PRO, Pursuit, Torment&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will soon release an in-detail publication with additional information on how herbicide rates and soil characteristics influence rotational Industrial Hemp crop restrictions. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always read, understand and follow the pesticide label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist)&lt;br /&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://fyi.extension.wisc.edu/pat/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Glenn Nice&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Pesticide Applicator Training Program Manager)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the onset of the spray season and concerns regarding waterhemp and other troublesome weed species, farmers and consultants are further diversifying and including herbicides with soil residual activity in their weed control programs. This past week we received several questions regarding herbicide tank mixtures. One common question was whether brand and/or generic s-metolachlor/metolachlor-, atrazine- and/or mesotrione-based products could be tank-mixed. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/federal-insecticide-fungicide-and-rodenticide-act-fifra-and-federal-facilities&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;FIFRA&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; allows for the tank mixing of any pesticides or pesticides with fertilizer when &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; prohibited on the label. This means that, as long as it is not prohibited on the label, you can mix various registered labeled herbicides for weed control in a particular crop. However, there are a few things you should be aware of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;follow the proper order for tank mixing (see Purdue Extension Publication: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ppp.purdue.edu/wp-content/uploads/files/PPP-122.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Avoid Tank Mixing Errors&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some pesticides are not compatible (they can be chemically or physically incompatible). Thus, a jar test should be conducted prior to mixing and spraying to assure the products are indeed compatible. Remember, you are responsible if the mix “goes bad” in the tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;follow the most restrictive tank mix instructions for the products involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep in mind that use rates vary by product and formulation; don&amp;rsquo;t assume that rates are the same for all products with the same active ingredient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many labels, for example the new dicamba products registered for use in dicamba-resistant soybeans (Xtend), have statements such as: &lt;strong&gt;use approved tank mix products as directed by the label or website&lt;/strong&gt;. This statement prohibits all tank mixes except for the ones the manufacturer has approved and specifies in their labels or webpages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While making your own pre-mix may reduce costs, it may increase the chances for error (e.g., the likelihood of accurately picking and measuring one product off of the shelf is higher than when multiple tank mix partners are involved) thus increasing the potential for crop injury, carryover concerns and/or lack of appropriate weed control. Commercially available pre-mix herbicides have been extensively studied by the chemical companies with the objective to enhance weed control while minimizing crop injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When developing a custom pre-mix or selecting a commercially available pre-mix herbicide, it’s important that farmers and crop consultants understand their target weed species and soil types, and have a solid crop rotation plan in mind. Knowing the weed species present in a particular field will allow for selecting effective active ingredient(s) to optimize weed control while minimizing the spray of unnecessary active ingredients. Understanding that soils (texture, pH and OM) vary across and within fields will allow for proper herbicide rate selection, optimizing weed control while minimizing chances for crop injury and/or carryover into subsequent crops.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are You PRE-pared for the Soybean (and Waterhemp) Growing Season?</title>
      <link>/post/are-you-pre-pared-for-the-soybean-growing-season/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist)&lt;br /&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;http://coolbean.info/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shawn Conley&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Soybean and Small Grain Specialist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring has arrived rather quickly in Wisconsin and the planting season is right around the corner (or perhaps it has already started for some growers). Before getting their soybeans in the ground, farmers should make sure they have solid weed management plans for the growing season, particularly if waterhemp is present in their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/2018-wisconsin-cropping-systems-weed-science-survey/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 SURVEY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, several Wisconsin soybean fields get only treated with a one-pass POST-emergence herbicide program (keep in mind that pre-plant tillage is a common practice adopted in Wisconsin cropping systems and that helps farmers “start clean”). Because of the widespread occurrence of waterhemp populations resistant to glyphosate and/or other POST-emergence herbicides (e.g., ALS- and PPO-inhibitors; see article: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/herbicide-resistance-in-wisconsin-an-overview/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Herbicide Resistance in Wisconsin: An Overview”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) combined with its extended emergence window (mid-May through July), a one-pass POST-emergence program in soybeans is likely not a viable strategy in fields infested with waterhemp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, research conducted across the Midwest has demonstrated the importance of keeping the soybean crop weed-free from establishment through the V3 growth stage &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.coolbean.info/library/documents/2017_Soybean_GrowthDev_Guide_FINAL.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;3rd trifoliate&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. Weeds emerging after the V3 growth stage will likely not impact soybean yield; however, they should still be proactively managed to prevent them from reproducing and replenishing the seedbank (remember “no seed, no weed”). Thus, effective PRE-emergence herbicides can help farmers maintain their fields weed-free during initial establishment of the crop (= achieve full yield potential) and also reduce the selection pressure on POST-emergence herbicides (due to fewer weeds to be controlled POST-emergence), helping on the fight against herbicide resistance.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018 Soybean PRE/Value of PRE.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;PRE&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Several PRE-emergence herbicides are available for soybeans. Most of them should be applied pre-plant up to 3 days after planting (see product label). To maximize their residual activity in-season, PRE-emergence herbicides should be sprayed at or shortly after planting. PRE-emergence herbicides need moisture for incorporation and activation in the soil. If there are established weeds at the time of PRE-emergence application and no additional pre-plant field cultivation will take place, it’s important to have an effective burndown herbicide in the tank-mix. A PRE-emergence herbicide containing 2 or more effective sites of action (SOA) will likely provide control of a wider range of weed species when compared to the use of a single SOA. Using multiple effective SOA during each pass is also a proactive strategy for herbicide resistance management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018 we conducted a study to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of multiple PRE-emergence soybean herbicides (see results: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/img/2018%20waterhemp%20challenge/Waterhemp%20Management%20PRE%20Comparison_Lancaster%20WI%202018.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 UW Waterhemp Challenge: Comparison of Soil Residual Herbicides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). While these results should be taken with a grain of salt (only one year of data), they clearly indicate the value of PRE-emergence herbicides and the programs that don’t work. This study will be replicated at multiple locations during the 2019 growing season. Stay tuned for our field days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018 Soybean PRE/2018 PRE Results.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;PRE&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When selecting a PRE-emergence herbicide program, we challenge agronomists and farmers to balance efficacy (using our results and their experience), product cost, and rotation restrictions. We also encourage farmers to use the labeled rate for their soils. The residual activity of a PRE-emergence herbicides is dependent on the rates applied; cutting rates is not a recommended strategy when attempting to manage troublesome weeds like waterhemp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that under cool and wet conditions during crop emergence, PRE-emergence herbicides containing metribuzin (Group 5), PPO-inhibitors (Group 14; e.g.: flumioxazin, saflufenacil, sulfentrazone) and VLCFA-inhibitors (Group 15; e.g.: acetochlor, dimetenamid-P, pyroxasulfone and S-metolachlor) may cause some early-season crop injury, particularly in lighter soils with low OM and/or higher pH. Our preliminary research in Nebraska has demonstrated that early-season crop injury caused by metribuzin (group 5) and sulfentrazone (group 14) did not lead to yield reduction (soybeans are indeed very resilient). Moreover, the benefit of an early-season weed-free field outweighs the concerns of early-season crop injury (assuming a herbicide is applied according to the label and no significant stand reduction is observed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To visualize the various types of injury potentially caused by different SOA herbicides, check our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/img/2018%20Herbicide%20SOA%20injury%20chart/2018_HerbicideInjury_EN.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herbicide Site of Action Key for Crop Injury Symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist),
&lt;a href=&#34;http://ipcm.wisc.edu/contacts/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dan Smith&lt;/a&gt; (UW NPM Southwest Wisconsin Regional Specialist) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://coolbean.info/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shawn Conley&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Soybean and Small Grain Specialist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Adapted from original article written by Rodrigo Werle and Dan Smith, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fall-planted cereal rye is increasingly used as a cover crop to protect the soil during winter and spring in corn and soybean cropping systems across the Midwest. Our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/2018-wisconsin-cropping-systems-weed-science-survey/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 survey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; indicated that 77% of Wisconsin farmers and Ag professionals are interested in cover crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fall-planted cereal rye is awakening and will start growing rapidly in southern Wisconsin; thus, it’s important to have a termination plan in mind prior to crop establishment. The following pictures demonstrate the rapid cereal rye growth during a 10-day interval in the spring of 2018:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018 cc rye termination/IMG_2102.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;small&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. Picture of a cereal rye cover crop field in south-central Wisconsin taken on April 30, 2018.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018 cc rye termination/IMG_2163.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;large&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Picture of the same cereal rye cover crop field in south-central Wisconsin taken on May 10, 2018.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cereal-rye-cover-crop-termination-strategies&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cereal Rye Cover Crop Termination Strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;herbicides&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herbicides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research conducted in Missouri showed that 28 fl oz of Roundup (glyphosate) provided satisfactory control of cereal rye (Figure 3). The early termination treatment (early-April) resulted in slightly better control than the later termination treatment (early-May). Glyphosate efficacy decreases when plants reach reproductive stages. The contact herbicide Gramoxone was also tested and was not as effective as glyphosate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018 cc rye termination/Missouri Visual Control.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Missouri&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. Influence of herbicide treatments and application timings on the control of cereal rye cover crop (results averaged across 3 years of research in Missouri). Data collected by Dr. Kevin Bradley’s research group at the University of Missouri.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research conducted in Wisconsin also demonstrated that glyphosate provided successful termination of cereal rye (see: &lt;a href=&#34;http://ipcm.wisc.edu/download/pubsPM/AnnualRye_WinterRye_Glyphosate.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination of winter rye and annual ryegrass using glyphosate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;roller-crimper&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roller-Crimper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to research conducted in Pennsylvania, roller-crimpers can be used effectively for cereal rye termination after the boot stage (Figure 4). Although not widely used across the Midwest, the use of roller-crimpers is a viable strategy for producers that would like to have additional biomass in the spring before crop planting and use a mechanical strategy for cover crop termination rather than herbicides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018 cc rye termination/Roller Crimper.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;RollerCrimper&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. Roller-crimper rolling down cereal rye cover crop in Pennsylvania. Picture obtained from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://integratedweedmanagement.org/index.php/iwm-toolbox/cultural-practices/cover-cropping/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;USDA Integrated Weed Management Resource Center Website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For additional information on roller-crimpers, watch the video: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtxH4CJa-jk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advances using the roller-crimper for organic no-till in Wisconsin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;cereal-rye-cover-crop-termination-considerations&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cereal Rye Cover Crop Termination Considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If glyphosate is used for cereal rye termination, it should be sprayed when day temperatures are above 55° F and night temperatures are above 40° F. For more effective cereal rye control, glyphosate should be applied before the boot stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact herbicides such as paraquat (e.g., Gramoxone) and glufosinate (e.g., Liberty, Cheetah, Scout, etc.) may be used for cereal rye termination; however, they may not provide adequate control if the cereal rye is at boot or later stages. As with any contact herbicide, practices to improve spray coverage will improve efficacy (e.g., medium spray droplet size and higher application rates [GPA]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If cereal rye will be harvested for forage, herbicides should be sprayed after biomass harvest and removal from the field to control the cereal rye regrowth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a legume is part of the cover crop mix, using a growth regulator herbicide such as 2,4-D or dicamba will enhance termination (see planting restrictions prior to selecting a growth regulator for cover crop termination).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If glyphosate-resistant weeds are established at cereal rye termination (e.g., marestail, giant ragweed), adding herbicides such as 2,4-D and/or saflufenacil (e.g., Sharpen) to the tank-mix will assist with their control (see label for planting restrictions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;UW-Madison and other researchers across the Midwest recommend terminating cover crops before crop planting (see: &lt;a href=&#34;http://coolbean.info/library/documents/CPN-4002.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cover Crops Do’s and Don’t’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late termination of cereal rye may reduce the yield potential of the main crop from excessive soil water use, temporary sequestration of plant available nutrients that are critical for the early development of the subsequent cash crop (particularly nitrogen for corn), and/or excessive amounts of residue that can difficult planting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cover crops may suppress troublesome weeds, but typically do not provide complete weed control alone. Combining cover crops and herbicide programs (including PRE-emergence herbicides) can be a powerful strategy for weed management in conventional cropping systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cover crop residue may alter the fate of soil-applied PRE-emergence herbicides. Rainfall after application is necessary to move pre-emergence herbicides into the soil profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Producers are encouraged to visit with their insurance provider when deciding the time for cover crop termination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Always check the herbicide labels before application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to our 2018 weed management &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/2018-wisconsin-cropping-systems-weed-science-survey/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SURVEY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, waterhemp has become the most concerning weed species in field crop production in Wisconsin. Thus, we invite farmers and crop advisors to attend one of our Wisconsin Regional Waterhemp Workshops to be held in four locations across the state in March of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt; &lt;strong&gt;These workshops are FREE with 3 CEUs (PM) available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Understanding the additional buffer requirements for dicamba applications in Xtend (dicamba-tolerant) crops</title>
      <link>/post/dicamba-buffer-requirements/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 31, 2018 the United States &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.epa.gov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; announced their decision to extend the registration of the dicamba products Engenia, Fexapan, and Xtendimax for use in dicamba-tolerant crops (Xtend technology) through December 20, 2020; however, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-changes-dicamba-registration&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;additional label changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A particular change that has led to some questioning is the new &lt;strong&gt;57-foot omnidirectional buffer&lt;/strong&gt; requirement to protect federally listed threatened and endangered species and critical habitat in specific US counties. On November 19, 2018, EPA posted the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=EPA-HQ-OPP-2016-0187-0974&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;list of US counties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where threatened and endangered species and critical habitat may exist (thus locations where the new 57-foot buffer must be incorporated).
218 US counties in 24 states are listed; see maps and figure below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018 dicamba buffer/map4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Figure 1&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018 dicamba buffer/map5.png&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Figure 2&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018 dicamba buffer/Figure1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Figure 3&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maps generated my &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/maxwelco&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Maxwel Oliveira&lt;/a&gt;, UW-Madison Weed Science Research Associate. &lt;strong&gt;Information obtained on December 11, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant label change pertaining to buffer requirements is that additional &lt;strong&gt;non-sensitive areas&lt;/strong&gt; may be included as part of the 110-foot downwind buffer and also the 57-foot omnidirectional buffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to EPA, the following areas (“non-sensitive areas”) may be included in the buffer distance calculation when directly adjacent to the treated field edges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Roads, paved or gravel surfaces, mowed and/or managed areas adjacent to field such as rights of way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Planted agricultural fields containing: corn, cotton, and soybeans.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Areas covered by the footprint of a building, silo, or other man made structure with walls and or roof.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;/img/2018 dicamba buffer/LimitationForMay 2019 (1).pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EPA Endangered Species Protection Bulletin (valid for May 2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;practical-implications-for-certified-applicators&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical Implications for Certified Applicators:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is required for certified applicators using these products (Engenia, Fexapan and/or Xtendimax) to follow the measures contained in the Endangered Species Bulletins for the area which they are applying the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To obtain Bulletins, consult &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.epa.gov/endangered-species&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.epa.gov/endangered-species&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or call &lt;strong&gt;1-844-447-3813&lt;/strong&gt; no more than six months before using the product. Applicators must use the Bulletin valid for the month in which they will apply the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the listed counties where threatened and endangered species and critical habitat may exist, besides the 110-foot downwind buffer, 57-foot buffer around the other sides of the field (omnidirectional) are now required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In counties where threatened and endangered species and critical habitat are not listed, the 110-foot downwind buffer still applies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-sensitive areas described above may be included in the buffer distance calculation when directly adjacent to the treated field edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And remember, DO NOT spray if sensitive crops or residential areas are adjacent and downwind of application area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those interested in the additional pertinent changes in the dicamba label, please visit the EPA website: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-changes-dicamba-registration&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-changes-dicamba-registration&lt;/a&gt; and read the registrants updated labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph Zimbric (UW-Madison Agronomy Graduate Student), &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/dave-stoltenberg/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;David Stoltenberg&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Agronomy Professor), &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/mark-renz/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mark Renz&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Weed Scientist) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Weed Scientist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;20-unique-cases-of-herbicide-resistance-in-wisconsin&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20 Unique Cases of Herbicide Resistance in Wisconsin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20 unique cases (weed species by herbicide site of action) of herbicide resistance have been confirmed in Wisconsin, including 13 weed species with evolved resistance to one or more herbicide sites of action (Figure 1, Table 1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first confirmed case of herbicide resistance in Wisconsin was PSII inhibitor resistance in common lambsquarters in 1979.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since then, ALS-inhibitor resistance has been confirmed in more weed species than other type of herbicide resistance, totaling eight weed species including common ragweed, giant ragweed, Palmer amaranth, and waterhemp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In comparison, PSII inhibitor resistance has been confirmed in four species, whereas ACCase inhibitor resistance has been confirmed in only two species (giant foxtail and large crabgrass).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first confirmed case of glyphosate (an EPSP synthase inhibitor) resistance in Wisconsin was a non-rapid response phenotype of giant ragweed in 2011 (Figure 2). Glyphosate resistance has subsequently been confirmed in horseweed, waterhemp, Palmer amaranth, and most recently, common ragweed in 2018.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018 resistance overview/Figure 1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Figure 1&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018 resistance overview/Table 1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Table 1&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018 resistance overview/Figure 2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Figure 2&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;waterhemp-in-wisconsin&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waterhemp in Wisconsin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waterhemp presence has increased rapidly in Wisconsin to include over 400 locations in 61 of 72 counties in the state (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, glyphosate resistance concerns have focused on waterhemp which has also increased rapidly to include confirmed cases in 28 counties (Figure 4). Among these, multiple resistance to glyphosate and PPO inhibitors has been confirmed in 10 counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018 resistance overview/Figure 3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Figure 1&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018 resistance overview/Figure 4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Figure 2&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;palmer-amaranth-in-wisconsin&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Palmer amaranth in Wisconsin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palmer amaranth was first identified in Wisconsin in 2011.  Since then, 12 populations have been found among nine counties (Figure 5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herbicide resistance in Palmer amaranth has been limited to two cases of confirmed glyphosate resistance and one case of confirmed multiple resistance to ALS inhibitors and the HPPD inhibitor tembotrione (Figure 5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/2018 resistance overview/Figure 5.png&#34; alt=&#34;&amp;quot;Figure 1&amp;quot;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;grower-concerns&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grower Concerns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glyphosate resistance in waterhemp, and multiple resistance to glyphosate and PPO inhibitors, have increased rapidly in Wisconsin indicating that effective waterhemp management will continue to be a top concern of Wisconsin growers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herbicide resistance in Palmer amaranth is currently limited to three counties in southern Wisconsin, but glyphosate resistance in two populations, and multiple resistance to ALS and HPPD inhibitors in another population, also have serious management implications for Wisconsin growers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is critical that diversified management tactics be implemented to reduce the spread, persistence, and impact of these and other herbicide-resistant species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&#34;https://agronomy.wisc.edu/rodrigo-werle/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rodrigo Werle&lt;/a&gt; (UW-Madison Extension Cropping Systems Weed Scientist), &lt;a href=&#34;http://ipcm.wisc.edu/contacts/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dan Smith&lt;/a&gt; (UW NPM Southwest Wisconsin Regional Specialist) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://horticulture.wisc.edu/academic_staff/richard-proost/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Richard Proost&lt;/a&gt; (UW NPM Sr. Outreach Specialist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waterhemp management in soybeans was a challenge for several farmers in 2018. As we finalize harvesting our crops, it’s important to properly map the fields infested with waterhemp and start developing an effective management plan for 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of PRE-emergence herbicides is a foundation for waterhemp control in soybeans. According to our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wiscweeds.info/post/2018-wisconsin-cropping-systems-weed-science-survey/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SURVEY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; conducted earlier this year, the use of a single POST herbicide pass is still a common weed control strategy for several farmers in Wisconsin. Unfortunately, as many learned this year, this strategy will likely not work if glyphosate-resistant waterhemp is present in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018 we conducted a study to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of multiple PRE-emergence soybean herbicides. This was a joint effort between the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ipcm.wisc.edu/npm/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UW-Madison Nutrient and Pest Management Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (NPM; Dan Smith and Richard Proost) and my team (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/wiscweeds?lang=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WiscWeeds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; Maxwel Oliveira, Victor Ribeiro, Sarah Striegel, Nikola Arsenijevic, and Ryan DeWerff). The study was conducted at &lt;a href=&#34;https://lancaster.ars.wisc.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UW Lancaster Ag Research Station&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in Lancaster, Grant County, southwest WI in a field with natural and significant waterhemp and common lambsquarters infestation. Treatments consisted of PRE-emergence soybean herbicides containing one, two and three different active ingredients and/or sites of action. Herbicides were sprayed the day after soybeans were planted. Since we wanted to evaluate the residual activity of the PRE-emergence herbicide treatments throughout the season, no POST-emergence herbicides were sprayed to the research plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our intent was not to promote one product versus another, instead, demonstrate the value of using an effective PRE-emergence herbicide program. Three well-attended and well-received plot tours were held at the research site in the summer. Per request of those who attended and also from several of those who could not attend the plot tours, we decided to make our 2018 findings available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To download the &lt;a href=&#34;/img/2018 waterhemp challenge/Waterhemp Management PRE Comparison_Lancaster WI 2018.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018 Preliminary Report of the “UW Waterhemp Challenge: Comparison of Soil Residual Herbicides” (PDF file) click HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these results should be taken with a grain of salt (only one year of data), they clearly indicate the value of PRE-emergence herbicides and the programs that don’t work. Moreover, the herbicide rates used in the study are the ones recommended by our industry colleagues and supported by us for a typical Wisconsin Silt Loam soil, thus, valuable information for decision-makers. In this publication we also include site and study information, pictures of plots, and the equivalent rate of single active ingredient products in the premixes evaluated (herbicides with multiple active ingredients).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When selecting a PRE-emergence herbicide program, we challenge agronomists and farmers to balance efficacy (using our results and their experience), product cost, and rotation restrictions. We also encourage farmers to compare their use rates with the ones used in our study (recommended by industry representatives and respective product labels), assuming Silt Loam soils. The residual activity of a PRE-emergence herbicide is dependent on the rates applied; cutting rates is not a recommended strategy when attempting to manage troublesome weeds like waterhemp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This same study will be replicated in at least two Wisconsin locations in 2019. Stay tuned for additional research findings related to our waterhemp control studies and also plot tour opportunities in 2019!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Take-Home from the “2018 Comparison of Soil Residual Soybean Herbicides Study”&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several PRE-emergence soybean herbicides evaluated provided good levels of waterhemp and lambsquarters control. The onset of waterhemp emergence in the research site was noticed in the first week of June. Because of excessive rainfall in the spring, soybean planting was delayed and happened on 05/24/2018 at the research site; thus, the application of our PRE-emergence treatments (05/25/2018) matched the time waterhemp started to emerge, explaining the overall satisfactory level of weed control observed in most treatments (perfect timing!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group 2 herbicides (e.g., Pursuit, Classic, First Rate) applied alone were effective on lambsquarters but NOT on waterhemp. The use of imazethapyr (e.g., Pursuit, Extreme, Thundermaster), which is a common practice in Wisconsin, did not provide satisfactory control of waterhemp. When using imazethapyr (which is an effective herbicide for control of several weed species) as part of the PRE-emergence herbicide program for waterhemp control, the tank mixture with or selection of herbicides that contain other effective active ingredient(s) is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRE-emergence herbicide programs containing multiple effective sites of action are recommended to broaden weed control spectrum and to lower selection for additional herbicide resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always read, understand and follow the pesticide label.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the widespread occurrence of herbicide-resistant weeds, corn and soybean farmers are having to diversify their herbicide programs to obtain adequate levels of weed control. The increased herbicide diversification increases the likelihood of crop injury due to carryover, misapplication, tank contamination, and/or drift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help you determine which herbicide(s) may be responsible for suspected injury on crops, this key uses the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ipcm.wisc.edu/download/pubsPM/Herbicide-Mode-of-Action.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;herbicide’s site of action (SoA) and respective Weed Science Society of America group number&lt;/a&gt;; herbicides within the same SoA can cause similar symptoms. After reaching a specific SoA, you can check if any of the herbicides from that group are the source of crop response. Herbicide control (selectivity) is specified for broadleaf and/or grass weed species and remember to also observe weeds for injury symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
