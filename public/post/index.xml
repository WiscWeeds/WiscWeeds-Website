      <description>Earlier this year we received a few complaints regarding lack of performance of dicamba (XtendiMax, Engenia, Status), 2,4-D (Enlist One) and/or glufosinate (Liberty) on POST control of waterhemp in corn and soybean fields in Wisconsin.
We invite Wisconsin farmers and agronomists to collect waterhemp seeds this fall from their row crop production fields where one of these three herbicides failed to provide effective POST control and submit them to UW-Madison for herbicide resistance screenings.</description>

      <description>As an additional measure to minimize the potential for off-site movement of dicamba, an approved volatility reduction agent (VRA), or also referred to as pH-buffering agent, is now required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to be tank mixed with over-the-top dicamba products (i.e., Engenia, Tavium plus VaporGrip, and XtendiMax with VaporGrip). These buffering agents reduce changes in spray solution pH by scavenging available protons in solution thus reducing the formation of dicamba acid (volatile form of dicamba).</description>

      <description>With increased temperatures and recent rain, Wisconsin fields that were planted with a cereal rye cover crop in the fall are showing signs of life. If you are planning to manage your cereal rye cover crop as part of an integrated weed management program for in season suppression of small seeded annual weeds, it is important to ensure a large amount of biomass is produced by the time of termination.</description>

      <description>Crop harvest is here and that means it’s time to be thinking about weed seedbank management. Over the last few weeks we have observed fields throughout Wisconsin with a fair amount of weed escapes. The most troublesome weeds in Wisconsin, waterhemp and giant ragweed, will retain their seeds well into October in the Upper Midwest. If you have weeds that have set seed in your field, now is the time to get out there, remove and burn them before combines start rolling.</description>

      <description>Favorable spring weather has given Wisconsin farmers a great start to the season with a fair amount of corn and soybean acres planted already. The recent trend in warmer temperatures will also lead to weed germination and emergence. However, the lack of significant rain events over recent weeks has left fields that had PRE-emergence herbicides applied without the moisture necessary for activation. This will likely result in weed escapes and place additional pressure on POST-emergence herbicides.</description>

      <description>The adoption of cover crops in corn-soybean production systems can help growers improve cropping system resiliency to extreme weather events, improve soil conservation and health, and slow the evolution of weed herbicide resistance. To get the most out of cover crops prior to corn and soybean establishment, growers should have a sound termination plan in mind to maximize cover crop benefits and successful establishment of the following cash crop.</description>

      <description>Waterhemp management in soybean was challenge for several Wisconsin farmers in 2019. The use of PRE-emergence herbicides is a foundation for effective waterhemp control; however, results from our &amp;ldquo;2018 weed management survey&amp;rdquo; indicated that the use of a single POST herbicide application is still a common weed control strategy for several farmers in the state. Furthermore, recent research by the UW-Madison Cropping Systems Weed Science Lab revealed that waterhemp resistance to glyphosate (EPSPS; Group 9) and imazethapyr (ALS; Group 2) is widespread across corn and soybean fields in Wisconsin, limiting effective POST herbicide control options, particularly in soybean (see “Wisconsin Waterhemp Herbicide Resistance Project – 2019 Update” for an in depth look at those results).</description>

      <guid>/post/herbicide-comparison-for-residual-waterhemp-control-in-corn/</guid>
      <description>Waterhemp management has become a major challenge for several corn and soybean farmers in Wisconsin and beyond. Waterhemp has an extended emergence window and is a competitive, prolific and genetically diverse weed species which has evolved resistance to commonly used corn and soybean herbicides across the Midwest (see 2019 Wisconsin Waterhemp Herbicide Resistance Project Update). The use of soil residual herbicides is a foundation for waterhemp control and given that several effective and flexible herbicide options in terms of application window (PRE through early-POST) are available for corn, this crop provides farmers with a good opportunity for effective waterhemp management.</description>

Waterhemp is a competitive, prolific and genetically diverse weed species which has evolved resistance to commonly used corn and soybean herbicides across the Midwest. In Wisconsin, waterhemp populations have been confirmed resistant to three sites of action (SOA): ALS (acetolactate synthase; Group 2), EPSPS (enolpyruvyl shikimate phosphate synthase; Group 9), and/or PPO-inhibitor herbicides (protoporphyrinogin oxidase; Group 14).</description>

Dr. Shawn Conley and team (Coolbean.info) recently released the 2019 yield data from their soybean variety trials conducted across the state of Wisconsin and concluded that no yield differences were observed across herbicide tolerance traits within nor across regions (Enlist E3, RR2 Xtend and LLGT27):

Herein, we would like to ask Wisconsin soybean producers and decision influencers to help us better understand herbicide tolerance trait and POST-emergence herbicide adoption in 2019 and their plans for 2020.</description>

Though native to Wisconsin, waterhemp has spread like wildfire and become a major problem in agricultural fields across the state in the past few years. In the fall of 2018, stakeholders submitted seed samples from 88 populations from across the state. UW-Madison Agronomy Grad Student Felipe Faleco has screened them for resistance to glyphosate and imazethapyr (Pursuit) and found that more than 90% of the waterhemp populations screened are resistant to both herbicides applied at their respective label rates (Roundup PowerMax at 22 fl oz/acre and Pursuit at 4 fl oz/acre).</description>

Marestail (aka horseweed) tends to be a troublesome weed species in no-till cropping systems across the Midwest and this year we received several inquiries regarding poor marestail control in parts of Wisconsin. Thus, we would like to invite Wisconsin farmers, crop consultants, educators and industry representatives that are dealing with this weed to collect seeds this fall from their row crop production fields and submit them to UW-Madison for herbicide resistance screenings (please collect marestail seed samples from fields with consistent infestation levels).</description>

Last week I took a group of UW-Madison Graduate Students to participate in the 2019 North American Weed Science Contest in Seymour, IL (July 24-26, 2019). Driving through the Interstate (I-74/I-39), Highways and country side, the off-target herbicide movement (puckered/cupped soybeans) and waterhemp pressure across central IL were evident. Thus, I would like to use this IL scenario as my “case study” for this article.</description>

Last week I released a blog post attempting to address the question regarding tank mixing safened S-metolachlor/metolachlor, atrazine and/or mesotrione-based products for weed control in corn (see: &amp;ldquo;Can brand or generic herbicides be tank-mixed? Part-2&amp;rdquo;).
The mesotrione products that I checked during my label search (i.e., Callisto, Explorer, Mesotrione 4SC and Meso Star) stated the following restriction: “DO NOT apply this product post-emergence in a tank mix with emulsifiable concentrate grass herbicides, unless specifically directed under one of the tank mix section of this label, or crop injury can occur”.</description>

Last month we released a blog post entitled “Can brand or generic herbicides be tank-mixed?&amp;rdquo; and in the first paragraph we wrote “This past week we received several questions regarding herbicide tank mixtures. One common question was whether brand and/or generic S-metolachlor/metolachlor, atrazine and/or mesotrione-based products could be tank-mixed”.
After speaking with industry colleagues, I learned that in the original blog post we described several important aspects to consider when developing a custom herbicide tank mix but did not actually answer if S-metolachlor/safened metolachlor, atrazine and/or mesotrione-based products could be tank-mixed; herein I will attempt to address this question.</description>

With the growing interest in producing industrial hemp in Wisconsin and beyond, it is important to pay close attention to rotation interval restrictions when planting this crop in conventional production fields where herbicides are adopted. Though no synthetic herbicides are labeled for weed control in industrial hemp in the United States at this time, it’s important to keep in mind that herbicides sprayed in previous crops can have an impact on the industrial hemp crop establishment and development.</description>

With the onset of the spray season and concerns regarding waterhemp and other troublesome weed species, farmers and consultants are further diversifying and including herbicides with soil residual activity in their weed control programs. This past week we received several questions regarding herbicide tank mixtures. One common question was whether brand and/or generic s-metolachlor/metolachlor-, atrazine- and/or mesotrione-based products could be tank-mixed.</description>

Spring has arrived rather quickly in Wisconsin and the planting season is right around the corner (or perhaps it has already started for some growers). Before getting their soybeans in the ground, farmers should make sure they have solid weed management plans for the growing season, particularly if waterhemp is present in their operations.</description>

Waterhemp management in soybeans was a challenge for several farmers in 2018. As we finalize harvesting our crops, it’s important to properly map the fields infested with waterhemp and start developing an effective management plan for 2019.
The use of PRE-emergence herbicides is a foundation for waterhemp control in soybeans.</description>

With the widespread occurrence of herbicide-resistant weeds, corn and soybean farmers are having to diversify their herbicide programs to obtain adequate levels of weed control. The increased herbicide diversification increases the likelihood of crop injury due to carryover, misapplication, tank contamination, and/or drift.
To help you determine which herbicide(s) may be responsible for suspected injury on crops, this key uses the herbicide’s site of action (SoA) and respective Weed Science Society of America group number; herbicides within the same SoA can cause similar symptoms.</description>

According to our recent SURVEY, waterhemp has become the most concerning weed in row crop production in Wisconsin. Thus, we invite Wisconsin farmers and agronomists to collect waterhemp seeds this fall from their row crop production fields and submit them to UW-Madison for herbicide resistance screenings (we ask farmers to collect samples from only one of their fields; preferably the one with the most troublesome infestation level).</description>

In 2017 the Xtend soybean technology was completely launched in the United States (e.g., Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] approval of dicamba-tolerant seed trait and POST-emergence application of labeled dicamba formulations). Despite the great level of broadleaf weed control observed when dicamba was sprayed POST-emergence in Xtend soybeans, particularly of the troublesome weeds giant ragweed and waterhemp, off-target dicamba movement is still a concern.</description>

At the beginning of July, the weather finally became conducive for POST-emergence herbicide applications in southern Wisconsin, including for dicamba application in Xtend (dicamba-tolerant) soybeans. Typically, injury from micro-rates of dicamba (via tank-contamination, particle and/or vapor drift) in susceptible crops tends to show at 10-14 days after the incident (see: Soybean Injury From Dicamba A4161). Driving around the southern part of Wisconsin this past week, I have noticed a couple instances of dicamba injury in soybeans (I estimate less than 15 total injured acres).</description>

Excessive and constant rainfall through the season thus far across southern Wisconsin has challenged timely herbicide applications in our experimental plots. If not raining, the wind was often blowing or the soil was too wet to even backpack spray. After spending several years in Nebraska, I learned that one can’t complain about rain, but come on! Still, we have managed to get most of our herbicide treatments out (thanks to a dedicated and hard-working research team that is literally not afraid of getting some mud on their boots!</description>

Under a new emergency rule, Palmer amaranth has been labeled as a prohibited noxious weed seed in Wisconsin. Given Palmer amaranth&amp;rsquo;s aggressive nature, this is a worthwhile and necessary attempt to keep this troublesome weed species out of the state. For more details, see DATCP article: “Keep an Eye Out for Palmer Amaranth, DATCP Cautions”.
Palmer amaranth’s late and extended emergence window throughout the growing season and vigorous growth rate (up to 2 inches per day under ideal conditions) make control in row crops very difficult.</description>

Adding to that challenge, glyphosate-resistant waterhemp populations have been confirmed in 25 Wisconsin counties (see map below). Furthermore, PPO-resistant waterhemp has been confirmed in 4 counties (Iowa, Monroe, Saint Croix, and Pierce). Resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides is widespread across the Midwest but has not been fully investigated in Wisconsin.</description>
