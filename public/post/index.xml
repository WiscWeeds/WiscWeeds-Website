*Adapted from original article written by Rodrigo Werle and Dan Smith, 2018.
Fall-planted cereal rye is increasingly used as a cover crop to protect the soil during winter and spring in corn and soybean cropping systems across the Midwest. Our 2018 survey indicated that 77% of Wisconsin farmers and Ag professionals are interested in cover crops.</description>

According to our 2018 weed management SURVEY, waterhemp has become the most concerning weed species in field crop production in Wisconsin. Thus, we invite farmers and crop advisors to attend one of our Wisconsin Regional Waterhemp Workshops to be held in four locations across the state in March of 2019.
 These workshops are FREE with 3 CEUs (PM) available.</description>

On October 31, 2018 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced their decision to extend the registration of the dicamba products Engenia, Fexapan, and Xtendimax for use in dicamba-tolerant crops (Xtend technology) through December 20, 2020; however, additional label changes were made.
A particular change that has led to some questioning is the new 57-foot omnidirectional buffer requirement to protect federally listed threatened and endangered species and critical habitat in specific US counties.</description>

Waterhemp management in soybeans was a challenge for several farmers in 2018. As we finalize harvesting our crops, it’s important to properly map the fields infested with waterhemp and start developing an effective management plan for 2019.
The use of PRE-emergence herbicides is a foundation for waterhemp control in soybeans.</description>

With the widespread occurrence of herbicide-resistant weeds, corn and soybean farmers are having to diversify their herbicide programs to obtain adequate levels of weed control. The increased herbicide diversification increases the likelihood of crop injury due to carryover, misapplication, tank contamination, and/or drift.
To help you determine which herbicide(s) may be responsible for suspected injury on crops, this key uses the herbicide’s site of action (SoA) and respective Weed Science Society of America group number; herbicides within the same SoA can cause similar symptoms.</description>

According to our recent SURVEY, waterhemp has become the most concerning weed in row crop production in Wisconsin. Thus, we invite Wisconsin farmers and agronomists to collect waterhemp seeds this fall from their row crop production fields and submit them to UW-Madison for herbicide resistance screenings (we ask farmers to collect samples from only one of their fields; preferably the one with the most troublesome infestation level).</description>

In 2017 the Xtend soybean technology was completely launched in the United States (e.g., Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] approval of dicamba-tolerant seed trait and POST-emergence application of labeled dicamba formulations). Despite the great level of broadleaf weed control observed when dicamba was sprayed POST-emergence in Xtend soybeans, particularly of the troublesome weeds giant ragweed and waterhemp, off-target dicamba movement is still a concern.</description>

At the beginning of July, the weather finally became conducive for POST-emergence herbicide applications in southern Wisconsin, including for dicamba application in Xtend (dicamba-tolerant) soybeans. Typically, injury from micro-rates of dicamba (via tank-contamination, particle and/or vapor drift) in susceptible crops tends to show at 10-14 days after the incident (see: Soybean Injury From Dicamba A4161). Driving around the southern part of Wisconsin this past week, I have noticed a couple instances of dicamba injury in soybeans (I estimate less than 15 total injured acres).</description>

Excessive and constant rainfall through the season thus far across southern Wisconsin has challenged timely herbicide applications in our experimental plots. If not raining, the wind was often blowing or the soil was too wet to even backpack spray. After spending several years in Nebraska, I learned that one can’t complain about rain, but come on! Still, we have managed to get most of our herbicide treatments out (thanks to a dedicated and hard-working research team that is literally not afraid of getting some mud on their boots!</description>

Under a new emergency rule, Palmer amaranth has been labeled as a prohibited noxious weed seed in Wisconsin. Given Palmer amaranth&amp;rsquo;s aggressive nature, this is a worthwhile and necessary attempt to keep this troublesome weed species out of the state. For more details, see DATCP article: “Keep an Eye Out for Palmer Amaranth, DATCP Cautions”.
Palmer amaranth’s late and extended emergence window throughout the growing season and vigorous growth rate (up to 2 inches per day under ideal conditions) make control in row crops very difficult.</description>

According to our recent SURVEY, waterhemp has become the most concerning weed in row crop production in Wisconsin. Adding to that challenge, glyphosate-resistant waterhemp populations have been confirmed in 25 Wisconsin counties (see map below). Furthermore, PPO-resistant waterhemp has been confirmed in 4 counties (Iowa, Monroe, Saint Croix, and Pierce). Resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides is widespread across the Midwest but has not been fully investigated in Wisconsin.</description>

Fall-planted cereal rye is growing rapidly in southern Wisconsin and it’s important to have a termination plan in mind prior to crop establishment.</description>

Spring has finally arrived in Wisconsin and so has the planting season. Before getting your soybeans in the ground, make sure you have plans for your PRE-emergence herbicide program. According to our recent SURVEY, several Wisconsin soybean fields get only treated with a one-pass POST-emergence herbicide program. Because of the spread of weed species resistant to glyphosate and/or other POST-emergence herbicides (e.</description>

PRE-emergence herbicides are the foundation for good weed control in corn and soybeans, particularly with the spread of herbicide-resistant weeds. The use of some PRE-emergence herbicides is limited to certain regions or counties in Wisconsin. Prior to selecting a herbicide for your weed management program, make sure the same is approved for use in your region by the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP).</description>

Introduction The objective of our survey was to evaluate the main weed species and management strategies adopted in Wisconsin cropping systems, particularly in corn and soybeans. The survey was conducted this winter during the 2018 Wisconsin Agronomy Update Meetings, held across the state. A total of 286 respondents, representing 54 counties, completed the survey.</description>
