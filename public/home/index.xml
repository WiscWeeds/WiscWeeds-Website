      <description>Our Research and Extension Program (WiscWeeds) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison focuses on agroecologically-based approaches to address sustainable weed management in corn, soybeans and small grains in Wisconsin and beyond. Our program also focuses on weed management strategies that can help address herbicide resistance, protect water quality, enhance agroecosystems services and increase food security.   2019 WiscWeeds Team

      <description>WiscWeeds Research Coalition - Ongoing Projects:
 Wisconsin Waterhemp Herbicide Resistance Project
 Wisconsin Combine Weed Seed Collection Project
  
Given the widespread occurrence of herbicide-resistant weeds across Wisconsin Cropping Systems, the shortage of novel herbicide sites of action, and the socioeconomic and environmental challenges herbicide-resistant weeds bring to farming operations and communities, it’s time for our industry to come together and work towards a similar goal: to promote and hopefully achieve effective and sustainable weed control in crop production systems.</description>
